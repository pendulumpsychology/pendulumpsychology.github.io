    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p style="font-style:italic">Can you fix me?</p>
    <p>I don't see anyone as being broken or damaged, or in need of fixing. I think it is normal to struggle with unwanted
        thoughts, feelings, or impulses, and some of these struggles can be more intense than others.</p><br><br>

    <p style="font-style:italic">In that case, what is the point of therapy?</p>
    <p>I think it can be useful to have a safe space to explore what is happening. Sometimes it can be useful to debrief,
        sometimes it can be useful to understand why the mind is doing what it is doing.</p><br><br>

    <p style="font-style:italic">How do I make an appointment with your practice?</p>
    <p>You can book directly into my calendar using the <a href='booking.html'>booking page.</a></p><br><br>

    <p style="font-style:italic">How much is a Medicare rebate, and how do I access Medicare rebates?</p>
    <p>Medicare rebates are currently $89.65, which means that a valid mental health treatment referral will entitle you to this
        amount back from Medicare if a session has been paid for and attended.<br><br>
        A valid mental health treatment plan is a plan written by your GP which involves a recommendation to see a psychologist.
        <br><br>
        Currently, rebates are available for up to 10 appointments per calendar year, in groups of 6 and then 4.
    </p>

    
    <p style="font-style:italic">What is your cancellation policy?</p>
    <p>In order to maintain the sustainability of my business, cancellations with less than 24 hours' notice will be charged the full fee.
        This fee is unfortunately not eligible for a Medicare rebate.
    </p>

    
    <p style="font-style:italic">Is online or telehealth therapy available?</p>
    <p>Indeed, </p>

    
    <p style="font-style:italic">How long does therapy usually last?</p>
    <p></p>

    
    <p style="font-style:italic">Is everything I discuss during therapy sessions confidential? What are the exceptions to confidentiality?</p>
    <p></p>

    
    <p style="font-style:italic">Do you accept worker's compensation or private health clients?</p>
    <p></p>
