    <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">Can you fix me?</p>
        <p>The perspective that someone needs 'fixing' often assumes that certain emotions or experiences need to
            be eradicated. However, this idea doesn't align with the realities of our emotional world. Emotions, thoughts,
            and feelings, even the challenging ones, are integral parts of our human experience. Instead of viewing ourselves
            as broken or in need of fixing, therapy encourages us to understand, explore, and learn how to navigate our
            emotional landscapes.
            <br><br>
        Therapy provides a safe, non-judgemental space to explore and express our thoughts and feelings, including
            the ones we might find difficult to handle or share with others. It's not always about 'curing' or 'fixing' -
            sometimes it's about gaining self-insight, understanding why our mind reacts the way it does, and developing
            self-compassion and self-acceptance. The value in therapy often lies in its ability to help us become more
            capable of experiencing a full range of emotions in a healthy
            way. This process might differ from the original goals or expectations one might have, but it is a journey
            towards a richer and more integrated self-understanding.</p><br><br>
        
    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">What is your policy regarding diversity and inclusion?</p>
    <p>I acknowledge the Ngunnawal people as the traditional custodians of the land on which I operate in Canberra,
        and pay my respects to their elders past, present, and emerging. I recognise the deep spiritual and cultural connection
        they have with their ancestral lands, and extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
        peoples today.<br><br>
        I firmly believe in the inherent dignity and worth of all individuals and am committed to providing a space of safety,
        respect, and confidentiality. This commitment extends across a multitude of aspects of personal identity, including
        but not limited to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, neurodivergence, and physical or mental disabilities.
        <br><br>
        Recognising that diversity also extends to relationship structure and personal lifestyle, I openly welcome
        individuals involved in polyamorous, ethically non-monogamous relationships, and those who identify with the
        kink/BDSM community. I also offer my services to individuals across various professions, including the sex work industry,
        as well as individuals of all religious and political beliefs.
        <br><br>
        I aim to understand and respect each client's unique experiences, providing care that is sensitive, informed, and
        catered to their individual identities and life journeys. The core of my practice is a safe, supportive, and
        non-discriminatory space, where the richness and diversity of the human experience is not only respected, but
        appreciated and celebrated. Everyone, with all their complexities, is warmly welcomed to my practice.
        </p><br><br>

        <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">Do you use pronouns?</p>
        <p>I'm committed to using the pronouns that each individual identifies and feels comfortable with, as I believe in the importance of respecting and acknowledging everyone's identity. For myself, I default to he/him. I recognise the importance of understanding individual experiences and perspectives surrounding gender identity, and I'm committed to providing a safe, respectful space for these discussions.</p><br><br>
        
    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">How do I make an appointment with your practice?</p>
    <p>You can book directly into my calendar using the <a href='https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/booking.html'>booking page.</a></p><br><br>

    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">How much is a Medicare rebate, and how do I access Medicare rebates?</p>
    <p>Medicare rebates for registered psychologists are currently $92.90, which means that a valid mental health treatment
        referral will entitle you to this
        amount back from Medicare if a session has been paid for and attended.<br><br>
        A valid mental health treatment plan is a plan written by your GP which involves a recommendation to see a psychologist.
        <br><br>
        Currently, rebates are available for up to 10 appointments per calendar year, in groups of 6 and then 4. This number is related
        to the calendar year, rather than the treatment plan, and unused rebates in one calendar year do not carry over. See this
        <a href="https://www.ama.com.au/gp-network-news/mental-health-care-plans-clarified" target="_blank">clarification on mental health
            treatment plans
        </a> for more information.
    </p><br><br>

    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">What is your cancellation policy?</p>
    <p>In order to maintain the sustainability of my business, cancellations with less than 24 hours' notice will be charged the full fee.
        This fee is unfortunately not eligible for a Medicare rebate.
    </p><br><br>

    
    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">Is online or telehealth therapy available?</p>
    <p>Yes, telehealth is available.</p><br><br>

    
    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">How long does therapy usually last? How frequently should sessions be?</p>
    <p>Therapy can last for as long as it is helpful. This will depend on the individual and their goals. Some people find a few sessions helpful to explore
        a few topics, while other people are more interested in longer term support and more thorough exploration.<br><br>
        The frequency of sessions is also dependent on the individual. Sessions can be too close together if it feels like you haven't had
        a chance to reflect on the previous session. Sessions can be too far apart if it feels like you have had too much happen in the
        interim that you would like to discuss, and there isn't much room for anything else.
    </p><br><br>

    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">What if I feel my issues are too complex for therapy?</p>
    <p>It's my belief that no matter how complex or daunting your issues may seem, they can be worked through in a safe,
        supportive, and non-judgmental therapeutic setting. The journey may be challenging, but you don't have to walk it
        alone. Therapy is about understanding and healing, not judgment or comparison. Everyone is worthy of help and
        healing, and that absolutely includes you.</p><br><br>

        <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">Are you a judgement-free therapist?</p>
        <p>Yes, absolutely. As a therapist, it's my role to provide a safe and supportive environment where you can
            express your thoughts, feelings, and experiences without fear of judgment. I believe that every behavior,
            emotion, or thought makes sense given its context, and my goal is to understand your context and help you
            navigate your emotional landscape.</p><br><br>

        <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">Can I contact you out of session if I'm in crisis?</p>
        <p>I'm unable to provide crisis support outside of our scheduled sessions. If you find yourself in crisis,
            it's very important to get in touch with professionals who are equipped to provide immediate assistance.
            Please refer to the <a href="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/alternatives.html">alternatives</a>
            page on my website for a list of available crisis support services.
            <br><br>
            Please remember that our scheduled sessions are your designated time to discuss and process your experiences,
            and I am fully present and committed to supporting you during these times. However, due to the structure of
            my practice, it is not possible for me to provide the level of availability required for crisis situations.
            Your safety and wellbeing are of utmost importance, and I strongly encourage you to reach out to the recommended
            crisis support services if you're in immediate need.</p><br><br>

        <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">What happens if therapy isn't working, or if I'm not making progress?</p>
        <p>Progress in therapy can often be nonlinear, with peaks and troughs rather than a steady, continuous climb.
            It's important to remember that some discomfort can be a normal part of the therapeutic process, especially
            when delving into deeper emotional territories. In these cases, it can feel as though things are getting worse
            before they get better, but this is often a sign of significant internal work being done.
            <br><br>
            However, it's also crucial that you feel you're benefiting from the therapy and moving in a direction
            that feels right for you. If you're concerned that you're not making progress, I encourage open discussion
            about these feelings. This can provide valuable feedback and allow us to collaboratively reassess our
            approach or explore different focus areas.
            <br><br>
            Should you continue to feel that therapy isn't working after these discussions and adjustments, it might
            be beneficial to consider another therapist or a different therapeutic service. Therapeutic fit is crucial,
            and different therapists have different styles, modalities, and areas of focus. Just as every client is
            unique, so is every therapeutic relationship. Sometimes, finding the right therapist or therapeutic
            approach may take a few tries, and that's completely okay.</p><br><br>

        <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">How will I know when I'm ready to end therapy?</p>
        <p>Knowing when to end therapy can depend on a range of factors and will differ for each person. Often, a
            natural point for ending therapy might come when you feel you've reached the goals that you set out to achieve
            at the beginning of your therapeutic journey. You might notice that the issues you initially sought help for
            have become more manageable, or that you've developed new insights into or ways of responding to your thoughts
            and feelings.
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, therapy might come to an end when it becomes financially more burdensome than beneficial,
            especially considering the limits on rebated sessions per calendar year under the Medicare model in Australia.
            Making a decision that respects your financial situation is important, and sometimes this means that therapy
            needs to come to a pause or close earlier than might be ideal in other circumstances.
            <br><br>
            Therapy could also conclude if you feel it's not working for you, or if you have doubts about the
            therapeutic process. If this is the case, it could be beneficial to discuss these feelings with me.
            We can then collaboratively explore what might be contributing to these feelings and reassess the
            approach to therapy. This would provide an opportunity to delve into why it doesn't seem to be working,
            to gain deeper insight, and to contemplate potential adjustments that align more closely with your
            needs and experiences.
            <br><br>
            It's also worth noting that the ending of therapy does not necessarily mean a complete cessation of all
            therapeutic activities. Many of the insights gained during therapy can continue to be refined in your
            day-to-day life. Furthermore, ending therapy doesn't preclude the possibility of returning in the future,
            should you feel the need for further support at another time.
            <br><br>
            As with all aspects of therapy, the decision to end therapy is highly personal and should be made in
            a way that feels right for you. I'm here to support you in that process, ensuring that the conclusion
            of our therapeutic relationship is respectful, supportive, and empowering.</p><br><br>
    
    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">Is everything I discuss during therapy sessions confidential? What are the exceptions to confidentiality?</p>
    <p>Client information is protected by confidentiality, and won't be released to anyone unless:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>You give consent for this release, e.g. feedback to a GP</li>
        <li>There is reason to believe that someone will come to harm if confidential information is not disclosed</li>
        <li>There is a subpoena for session notes as part of legal proceedings</li>
    </ul></p><br><br>
    
    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">Which funding bodies do you accept payment from?</p>
    <p>I currently accept privately funded clients, with or without Medicare rebates, as well as self-managed NDIS participants.
        At this time I am not accepting worker's compensation, DVA, Open Arms, or agency-manaaged or fund-managed NDIS participants.
    </p><br><br>

    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">What types of clients do you work with, and what sort of services do you provide?</p>
    <p>I am currently accepting new adult (18+) clients. I am not currently accepting new clients under the age of 18.
        I provide therapeutic services, and do not currently provide assessments or medico-legal reports.</p><br><br>
