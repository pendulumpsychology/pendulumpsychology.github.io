    <h1>FAQ</h2>
    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">Can you fix me?</p>
    <p>I don't see anyone as being broken or damaged, or in need of fixing. I think it is normal to struggle with unwanted
        thoughts, feelings, or impulses, and some of these struggles can be more intense than others.</p><br><br>

    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">In that case, what is the point of therapy?</p>
    <p>I think it can be useful to have a safe space to explore what is happening. Sometimes it can be useful to debrief,
        sometimes it can be useful to understand why the mind is doing what it is doing.</p><br><br>

    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">What is your policy regarding diversity and inclusion?</p>
    <p>I acknowledge the Ngunnawal people as the traditional custodians of the land on which I operate in Canberra,
        and pay my respects to their elders past, present, and emerging. I recognise the deep spiritual and cultural connection
        they have with their ancestral lands, and extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
        peoples today.<br><br>
        I also firmly believe in the inherent dignity and worth of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity,
        sexual orientation, relationship structure, profession, gender identity, neurodivergence, religion, disability, age, or any other
        characteristic or aspect of their identity or circumstance. I aim to create a safe,
        supportive, and non-discriminatory space for everyone. I respect, appreciate, and celebrate the rich diversity of the
        human experience, and welcome everyone to my practice.<br><br>
        It is also important to communicate that, due to circumstances beyond my control, both of my current practice locations
        require walking up stairs to access, which may pose a barrier for some. I regret any inconvenience or difficulty this may cause.
        Please feel free to reach out to me if you require any assistance or if you have any concerns or suggestions.</p><br><br>

        <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">Do you use pronouns?</p>
        <p>I'm committed to using the pronouns that each individual identifies and feels comfortable with,
            as I believe in the importance of respecting and acknowledging everyone's identity. As for myself,
            I don't feel a strong affinity to any particular set of pronouns, and am comfortable with any pronouns
            being used to refer to me. This personal perspective on my own pronouns doesn't affect my commitment to
            honouring the pronouns that others choose for themselves.</a></p><br><br>
    
    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">How do I make an appointment with your practice?</p>
    <p>You can book directly into my calendar using the <a href='https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/booking.html'>booking page.</a></p><br><br>

    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">How much is a Medicare rebate, and how do I access Medicare rebates?</p>
    <p>Medicare rebates for registered psychologists are currently $89.65, which means that a valid mental health treatment
        referral will entitle you to this
        amount back from Medicare if a session has been paid for and attended.<br><br>
        A valid mental health treatment plan is a plan written by your GP which involves a recommendation to see a psychologist.
        <br><br>
        Currently, rebates are available for up to 10 appointments per calendar year, in groups of 6 and then 4. This number is related
        to the calendar year, rather than the treatment plan, and unused rebates in one calendar year do not carry over. See this
        <a href="https://www.ama.com.au/gp-network-news/mental-health-care-plans-clarified" target="_blank">clarification on mental health
            treatment plans
        </a> for more information.
    </p><br><br>

    
    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">What is your cancellation policy?</p>
    <p>In order to maintain the sustainability of my business, cancellations with less than 24 hours' notice will be charged the full fee.
        This fee is unfortunately not eligible for a Medicare rebate.
    </p><br><br>

    
    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">Is online or telehealth therapy available?</p>
    <p>Yes, telehealth is available.</p><br><br>

    
    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">How long does therapy usually last? How frequently should sessions be?</p>
    <p>Therapy can last for as long as it is helpful. This will depend on the individual and their goals. Some people find a few sessions helpful to explore
        a few topics, while other people are more interested in longer term support and more thorough exploration.<br><br>
        The frequency of sessions is also dependent on the individual. Sessions can be too close together if it feels like you haven't had
        a chance to reflect on the previous session. Sessions can be too far apart if it feels like you have had too much happen in the
        interim that you would like to discuss, and there isn't much room for anything else.
    </p><br><br>

    
    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">Is everything I discuss during therapy sessions confidential? What are the exceptions to confidentiality?</p>
    <p>Client information is protected by confidentiality, and won't be released to anyone unless:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>You give consent for this release, e.g. feedback to a GP</li>
        <li>There is reason to believe that someone will come to harm if confidential information is not disclosed</li>
        <li>There is a subpoena for session notes as part of legal proceedings</li>
    </ul></p><br><br>
    
    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">Which funding bodies do you accept payment from?</p>
    <p>I currently accept privately funded clients, with or without Medicare rebates, as well as self-managed NDIS participants.
        At this time I am not accepting worker's compensation, DVA, Open Arms, or agency-manaaged or fund-managed NDIS participants.
    </p><br><br>

    <p style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">What types of clients do you work with, and what sort of services do you provide?</p>
    <p>I am currently accepting new adult (18+) clients. I am not currently accepting new clients under the age of 18.
        I provide therapeutic services, and do not currently provide assessments or medico-legal reports.</p><br><br>
