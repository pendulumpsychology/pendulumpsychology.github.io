          <h2>Repetition compulsion</h2>
          Freud observed that many individuals, without intending to, end up recreating distressing or traumatic dynamics or environments from their childhood. Freud called this
          "repetition compulsion". As there is no conscious intention to recreate the upsetting environment, it was assumed that repetition compulsion must be explained 
          by an unconscious drive. Freud believed it was associated with a "death drive", or a subconscious drive towards self-destruction. Lacan believed it was a way for the
          subconscious to signal to the conscious mind that there is subconscious material which needs to be addressed.
          <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/mirrors.webp" style="float: left; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">
          <br><br>
          Beyond psychoanalysis, the concept of repetition compulsion finds resonance in other therapeutic approaches. In schema therapy, for example, the idea of
          "schema chemistry" suggests that individuals are drawn to relationships and situations that activate their early maladaptive schemas, reinforcing painful
          patterns from childhood. This may be because these patterns are more familiar
          <br><br>
          I think there are multiple possible mechanisms behind
          the repetition compulsion. I also think that we can understand repetition compulsion through the more universal lens of yin and yang - that the environment and the
          adaptation are linked not just in a forward, causal sense, but in an interconnected, cyclical sense.
          <br><br>
          <h2>Yin and Yang</h2>
          <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/yinyang1.webp" style="float: right; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">Ancient Chinese philosophers
          created the terms yin and yang as a way of describing or understanding a relationship between two things which create, define, or sustain each other.
          Since this is a relationship between two things, something can be yin in one relationship and yang in another. Yin is defined as feminine, soft, receptive
          dark, passive, cold, flexible, yielding, relaxed, and slow. Yang is defined as the counterpart, which is masculine, hard, productive, light, active, warm,
          inflexible, firm, excited, and fast.
          Both were seen as necessary, in the way that the yin receptive space of a cup is only useful when surrounded by the firm yang of the cup's material, and a cup without
          a receptive yin space would be not useful for purpose.
          <br><br>
          The idea of yin and yang can give us a contrast between light and dark, in that 
          these qualities, as both are needed for balance 
          observed that things in nature maintain a dynamic equilibrium by cycling between opposites. For this to happen, opposites need to in some
          way create each other. We can see that this is true for some things - in the physical world, daytime leads to nighttime, which then leads to daytime. We can also observe
          this
          is true in our own physiology - for example, being vibrantly awake leads us to become sleepy, and a deep restful sleep allows us to be more alert when we wake up.
          On a more
          complex level, being restrictive with our food intake can cause a buildup of cravings which can lead us to binge, which then might create the shame which
          prompts us to restrict.
          Feelings of inferiority might drive us to excel, or to judge others, which creates a feeling of superiority, which can cause us to feel isolated and subsequently inferior.
          <br><br>
          Why should we care about the idea of yin and yang, or how each is defined, or their complex interdependency? This complex interdependency points to a paradox -
          yin turns into yang, but also, within yin is a core of yang. In some ways, yin can be more yang than yang is, and vice versa.
          <br><br>
          This concept is illustrated in chapter 36 of the Tao Te Ching, where Lao Tzu said that "the soft and weak overcome the hard and strong".
          This idea is further expanded in chapter forty three:
          <br><br>
          <span class="italics">
          The softest thing in the universe<br>
          Overcomes the hardest thing in the universe.<br>
          That without substance can enter where there is no room.<br>
          Hence I know the value of non-action.
          <br><br>
          Teaching without words and work without doing<br>
          Are understood by very few.
          </span><br><br>
          The same point is made again in chapter seventy six:
          <br><br>
          <span class="italics">
          A man is born gentle and weak.<br>
          At his death he is hard and stiff.<br>
          Green plants are tender and filled with sap.<br>
          At their death they are withered and dry.<br>
          <br><br>

          Therefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death.<br>
          The gentle and yielding is the disciple of life.

          Thus an army without flexibility never wins a battle.<br>
          A tree that is unbending is easily broken.
          <br><br>
          The hard and strong will fall.<br>
          The soft and weak will overcome.</span>
          <br><br>
          and again in chapter seventy eight:
          <br><br>
          <span class="italics">
          Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water.<br>
          Yet for attacking the solid and strong, nothing is better;<br>
          It has no equal.<br>
          The weak can overcome the strong;<br>
          The supple can overcome the stiff.<br>
          Under heaven everyone knows this,<br>
          Yet no one puts it into practice.<br>
          Therefore the sage says:<br>
          He who takes upon himself the humiliation of the people is fit to rule them.<br>
          He who takes upon himself the country's disasters deserves to be king of the universe.<br>
          The truth often sounds paradoxical.
          </span><br><br>
          When we strive to be productive, we can go off doing a bunch of useless things, and be less productive than if we had been more patient and developed
          a better understanding of what needs doing and how. When we strive to be active, we can deprive ourselves of enough recovery, and end up burning ourselves out.
          The tale of the tortoise and the hare is based on this principle. The US Navy seals say that slow is smooth and smooth is fast. The more we strive for a magic
          bullet to end our suffering, the more we suffer. The more logical we are, the closer we get to the bedrock of axioms which are paradoxically irrational.
          Could it be possible that <span class="italics">the more we cling to an adaptation, the more we invite the original environment?</span>
          <br><br>
          When we strive for an imbalance, we find undulation and receive imbalance in the opposite direction. We don't need to try and fail in multiple different
          domains, we can understand the ubiquity of this concept and be open to finding it in new places. In this way, we can see that the act of understanding and
          protecting the balance of yin and yang is actually more about protecting ourselves from the undulation which maintains the dynamic equilibrium in whichever domain we
          are looking at. The fact that protecting yin and yang from us, and us being protected from yin and yang, can be seen as interdependent opposites,
          is a perfect example of the concept itself.
          <br><br>
          How do we use this concept to navigate life? The ancient Chinese philosophers also had a concept called Wu Wei. There are many disagreements about what
          Wu Wei actually means, as it was originally written about in ancient Chinese. The symbol for Wu (無) means no, not, don't, nobody, or not yet. The symbol
          for Wei (為) means to make, to do, to govern, to construct, to become, to act. So there is a negation word, and a word for something that seems to align
          with the concept of yang. Wu Wei is often translated as non action or effortless action, and this is interpreted by some as being in a flow state. My
          inclination is for a different interpretation. Lao Tzu said "know the masculine, but stick to the feminine". In the examples of paradoxical outcomes
          above, all which start with yang backfire, while all which start with yin have pleasant outcomes. So I believe that the concept of Wu Wei is more accurately
          captured by the idea that things will take their natural course, that to fight against it is to invite disaster, and that to be open, flexible, and receptive,
          is generally a more beneficial default.
          <br><br>
          Does this mean we should do nothing? I don't think so - doing nothing involves suppressing our instincts to act. If there is benefit in not fighting
          against reality, this must also mean there is benefit in not fighting against our internal reality.
          But how could adaptation and environment form an interdependent cycle? And if they do, what can we do about it?
          Let's look more closely at how psychological adaptation might work.
          <br><br>
          <!-- The core ideas embodied in yin and yang find parallels in various philosophical traditions worldwide. The Greek philosopher Heraclitus said that
          "Opposition brings concord. Out of discord comes the fairest harmony", and spoke of how opposing forces lead to each other and how they in fact can be seen
          as the same thing, "the road up and the road down is one and the same".
          <br><br>
          Symbols resembling the yin-yang motif have been discovered on artifacts from diverse cultures, including a Roman shield, relics from the Ukrainian-Romanian
          border, and items from the European Iron Age. This suggests that the underlying principles of duality and cyclical change have resonated with human understanding
          across time and space.
          <br><br> -->
          <h2>Adaptation</h2>
          <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/defence.webp" style="float: left; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">
          Adaptation is the process by which organisms adjust to their environment to enhance their chances of survival and thriving. In the realm of psychology,
          adaptation refers to the ways individuals modify their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in response to their life circumstances.
          <br><br>
          While adaptation is a crucial skill, it can also have unintended consequences. When we adapt to a particular environment, especially in childhood, we can develop
          patterns and strategies that help us navigate that specific context. However, these same adaptations may prove less effective or even detrimental in other environments.
          <br><br>
          For example, a child raised in a household with unpredictable and emotionally volatile parents may learn to be hypervigilant and suppress their own needs to avoid
          triggering conflict. While these strategies may help the child cope in the short term, they can lead to difficulties in forming healthy relationships and asserting
          oneself in adulthood.
          <br><br>
          As a more in-depth example, consider a child who experiences consistent mistreatment from their primary caregivers. Initially, the child may resist this reality,
          thinking, "This is wrong; I shouldn't be treated this way." However, this stance often leads to internal turmoil and external conflict with the abusive parents.
          <br><br>
          In an attempt to alleviate this distress, the child may unconsciously adopt the belief, "I deserve this treatment." By internalising the notion that they are
          fundamentally flawed or unworthy, the child can stop fighting against their painful circumstances. This adaptation reduces the immediate anguish but comes at
          a high cost to the child's self-worth.
          <br><br>
          As the mistreated child grows into adulthood, they may intellectually recognise the falsehood of the belief that they deserve mistreatment. However,
          fully embracing their inherent worth and rejecting the internalised narrative of deservedness can be a daunting task.
          <br><br>
          To genuinely challenge this deeply ingrained belief, the individual may need to embrace the grief, rage,
          or uncertainty associated with giving up their adaptation to their early experiences.
          They may need to mourn the love, safety, and validation they were denied, grapple with the anger towards those who harmed them, and face the vulnerability that comes when
          we let go of a familiar pattern, and open ourselves up to the uncertainty of not knowing how things will go.
          <br><br>
          However, the subconscious mind, still operating from the perspective of the vulnerable child, may resist this process. It may fear that fully experiencing
          these intense emotions or lack of stability will be overwhelming, or lead to further rejection and abandonment. This subconscious resistance can contribute
          to the persistence
          of old patterns. Even when they no longer serve the individual - even when the individual consciously wants to get rid of them.
          <br><br>
          <h2>Interlude - expectancy effects</h2>
          Self-fulfilling prophecies are very common in psychology. People tend to act in the way they are expected to act, or in the way they are treated. We often treat ourselves
          internally the way others have treated us externally. If someone is intelligent they will often become known as intelligent and treated as such. However, this also 
          actually forms a cycle which can start at the other end - treating people as if they were intelligent has been found to increase their confidence and competence
          (this has been called the Pygmalion effect). Someone who has been treated poorly might be exhausted from being in fight or flight for so long, and respond reactively
          or defensively, which often worsens the way they are treated going forward. Treating a child as though they are a problem causes them to feel isolated, misunderstood,
          and resentful, which can then cause them to behave in a way which is problematic.
          <br><br>
          It's almost as if the way someone acts and the way they are treated form a cycle, where acting a certain way can cause reactions which perpetuate the way you have
          acted, or being treated as though you had acted a certain way can cause you to act in that way. In other words, treatment/environment may not cause adaptation or response
          in a unidirectional, causal arrow, but may be linked in a cycle with each other.
          <br><br>
          <h2>The Cycle of Environment and Adaptation</h2>
          <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/loop.webp" style="float: right; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">
          So we have found that, perhaps, the interplay between environment and adaptation can create a self-perpetuating cycle.
          An individual's early environment shapes their adaptations, which
          in turn can influence the environments they are drawn to and create in adulthood. A person who deeply believes they deserve to be mistreated, when presented with
          what appears to be a more genuinely nurturing relationship, may feel that this person is trying to trick them, or may feel afraid of getting their hopes up. This
          can create lots of tension, uncertainty, and fear.
          <br><br>
          As such, for the mistreated child, their adaptation to an abusive environment may lead them to unconsciously be less comfortable or open to relationships and
          situations that are different from the familiar dynamics of their childhood. They may therefore be more attracted to partners who mistreat them, or find themselves
          in toxic work environments that mirror the unpredictability and harshness of their early life. The adaptation which allowed them to find rest in an inescapable situation
          may be the same adaptation which causes them to feel safer in that same kind of relationship in the future.
          <br><br>
          <span class="italics">The adaptation causes the person to feel more comfortable in the environment they are adapted to - there will be no surprises, they
            know they can survive it, they know what will happen, and how to deal with it.
          </span>
          <br><br>
          In this way, we can see how the environment and the adaptation may feed into each other, creating a loop that reinforces the individual's painful experiences.
          Just as yin and yang
          are interdependent and cyclical, the environment and adaptation can give rise to each other, perpetuating the cycle of repetition compulsion.
          <br><br>
          <h2>Interlude - adaptation vs adaptable</h2>
          There is a difference betweeen being adaptable, and having an adaptation. Consider the following two images.<br>
          <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/adaptable.webp" style="max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">
          <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/adapted.webp" style="max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;"><br>
          Imagine that the dot wants to be close to the edge of the circle. In some cases, it needs to be close to a particular part of the circle.
          In the image on the right, the dot is close to the wall of the circle. The dot is adapted to a situation which requires it to be near that point of the wall. However,
          relative to the picture on the left, the dot is is much further away from most areas on the circumference, and would therefore be worse off if the location was not known,
          or was changeable. The dot in the image on the left is more flexible and adaptable, while the dot in the image on the right is more rigid and adapted.
          <br><br>
          <h2>Breaking the Cycle: The Power of a Nurturing Environment</h2>
          <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/growth1.webp" style="float: left; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">
          If we look at repetition compulsion through the lens of yin and yang, and with our adaptable vs adaptive distinction in hand, it makes sense to say that
          we need to move away from the yang of adaptation, of striving to defend ourselves, and make ourselves more adaptable, more vulnerable, more open. To stop
          imposing our previous experiences on our current reality. To let go and start afresh.
          <br><br>
          But this is easier said than done. Besides, wouldn't that mean exiting the loop, and thus the concept of yin and yang is not universal, but can be opted out of?
          <br><br>
          Possibly. Or we could perhaps say that we have entered into a new cycle. We can leverage the knowledge that adaptation and environment may create each other, and try
          to become adapted to a different environment. If our thoughts and actions are designed to protect us from a harsh environment, but those thoughts and actions
          paradoxically end up bringing that environment forward, what would it be like to be adapted to a more nurturing environment?
          <br><br>
          If we had experienced a more nurturing environment, how would we treat others? How would we treat ourselves? Would we see some emotions or facts as impossible to feel
          or think about, or would we be open and receptive?
          <br><br>
          Rumi said that <span class="italics">"your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it"</span>.
          <br><br>
          And so the key to breaking the cycle of repetition compulsion may lie in in either part of the cycle - in identifying and letting go of our adaptations
          and being open to seeing things the way they are, or in creating a new, nurturing environment that challenges our deeply held
          beliefs and adaptations. This is where the therapeutic relationship may play a crucial role - it may help with both ends of the cycle.
          <br><br>
          In a safe and supportive therapeutic space, the individual can begin to explore their painful experiences and the beliefs they have internalised.
          The therapist's empathy, validation, and consistent care provide an emotional experience that differs from the individual's early environment.
          <br><br>
          Within this nurturing context, the individual may feel more capable of processing the grief and rage associated with their past. They may begin to
          see themselves through a lens of compassion and understanding, recognising that their adaptations were necessary for survival but are no longer serving them.
          <br><br>
          As the individual internalises this new, nurturing environment, they can gradually reshape their self-image and expectations of relationships.
          They may start to believe that they are worthy of love, respect, and healthy connections. This shift in beliefs can then ripple out into their
          external world, influencing the environments they create and the relationships they cultivate.
          <br><br>
          <h2>The Spiral of Healing</h2>
          <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/spiral.webp" style="float: right; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">
          Just as the repetition compulsion can create a downward spiral, the experience of a nurturing therapeutic environment can generate an upward spiral of healing.
          As the individual internalises a more compassionate self-image, they become more likely to seek out and create nurturing relationships in their daily life.
          <br><br>
          These healthier connections further reinforce the individual's sense of worth and provide ongoing opportunities for growth and healing. The more the individual
          experiences positive, supportive interactions, the more they can rewrite the narratives that have held them back.
          <br><br>
          This upward spiral of healing is not always linear, and setbacks may occur along the way. In fact, setbacks will occur - the initial experience of a more nurturing
          environment may feel challenging and scary. Any movement in the deeply held beliefs may cause a release of grief, rage, and uncertainty, which
          can also be unpleasant. Learning
          that we can let go of our adaptations, and that we can handle the feelings that they have been holding back, can sometimes feel like going backwards or getting worse.
          <br><br>
          However, with each iteration of the cycle, the individual may strengthen their capacity for self-compassion, resilience, and healthy relationships.
          They may gradually break free from the pull of the repetition compulsion and move towards a more fulfilling and authentic life.
          <br><br>
          This is just one example of one particular childhood environment and one particular adaptation. There are many more possible environments, and even more possible
          adaptations. Understanding what these are often seems to involve reflecting on feelings, experiences, and noticing when the mind is engaging in motivated reasoning - 
          when it wants you to see things in a certain way, or believe a certain thing, even when that thing can't be known, or don't align with the current facts. If
          the mind is engaging in motivated reasoning to distort or obscure reality, it may be trying to protect you from something. What could it be trying to protect you from?
          Do you feel equipped to handle whatever it is that your mind is protecting you from?
          <br><br>
          Is therapy the only way forward? I don't think so. All we need to do is become aware of our patterns, and to find the willingness to be open and receptive to the truth,
          to new experiences, to uncertainty, and to whatever powerful emotions may arise. Having a therapist may help, but so too can mindfulness, self-compassion, and self-enquiry.
          <br><br>
          As with all general principles, this explanation will not perfectly explain everything. This explanation is also nowhere near as complex as
          the human mind, so it may be more correct in some situations than in others. Even where it does seem to fit, there is likely much more nuance and complexity to
          what is going on. However, I find this explanation to fit with my experience. I also quite enjoy reflecting on ubiquitous patterns, and believe we can learn
          from the wisdom of past philosophers.
