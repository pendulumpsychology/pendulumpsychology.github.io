          This post is about how we often find ourselves stuck in repeating patterns of relationships, and how this can sustain our mental health
          struggles.
          
          <br><br>
          
          Have you ever noticed that people often end up in relationships or friendships with people
          similar to a parent, or playing a role similar to the one they played as a child? A person who was mistreated by their parents as a child
          may end up dating people who mistreat them. A person who looked after their parents as a child may end up looking after people as a grown up. A
          person who was picked on and bullied as a child may end up in lots of conflict and fights as an adult. A person who was neglected as a child by
          emotionally distant parents may end up with someone who is neglectful and emotionally distant. A child who grew up in an environment where there
          was a lot of comparison and competition between the siblings may end up in a career that involves a lot of comparison and competition. 

          <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/mirrors.webp" style="float: left; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">
<br><br>

Freud called this "repetition compulsion". There are a few different theories on why this happens. One theory is that the subconscious mind is trying to
signal to the conscious mind that there is subconscious material that needs to be processed. Another theory is that the individual is subconsciously trying
to "master" the situation. There is also the idea that people are drawn to relationships which are familiar. 

<br><br>

There is nothing wrong with any of these ideas, and this post is broadly consistent with them. However I feel like there is something we can add to
these explanations, that tells us more about how we can understand why this is happening, and why the individual can't break out of the pattern.

<br><br>

In this post I want to reinterpret the patterns of relational dynamics that people get stuck in through the lens of yin and yang. I also want to look at a
few examples and talk about
"why" this may happens. If the examples will help us to understand "why" this happens, what do we need yin and yang for? The concept of yin and yang was
designed to be so abstract that it could be used to explain everything in the universe, which I think is quite elegant, and I also think it can give us
more of an indication of what we can do about it, as well as why it is so hard to change, and how trying to change it may actually propogate it. 

<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Yin and Yang</h2>
<p>

  <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/yinyang1.webp" style="float: right; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">
  
  For some background, let me explain the concept of yin and yang. Ancient Chinese philosophers created these terms as a way of describing or understanding
a relationship between two things which create, define, or sustain each other.



<br><br>

Everything that exists is brought into existence by something, and the concept of yin and yang implies that this relationship is circular and self sustaining,
rather than linear. For example, children turn into adults, and adults create children. Overgrown bushes create bushfires, which provide the necessary
conditions for dormant seeds to sprout. A clear sky over water creates the conditions for evaporation, leading to a storm, and a storm clears the skies
and returns water to the earth. 

<br><br>

On a psychological level, feelings of inferiority might cause a person to become judgemental of others in order to feel superior. This may push people away,
leading back to feelings of inferiority. A tendency to suppress an emotion might cause a buildup of that emotion, leading to an outburst that the person
feels was inappropriate, which might lead back to suppression. In a relationship, feelings of resentment might build until they lead to intense conflict,
which then might lead to guilt and love bombing, which may then prevent the person from addressing their issues in the relationship, leading to further resentment.
In a complex relationship with food, emotional eating or bingeing may lead to guilt and food restriction, which might then lead to increased cravings and distress,
leading to more emotional eating or bingeing. Keeping people at arm's length might lead to loneliness, causing the person to reach out to an inappropriate person
or in an inappropriate way, leading to a distressing experience and back to keeping people at arm's length. Self criticism may lead to feeling defeated,
discouraged, and hopeless, which may lead to reduced activity, achievement, or connection, which may then lead to more self criticism. 

<br><br>

So we can see that many things form self-sustaining cycles. Let's now briefly leave the concept of yin and yang, to look more closely at how relational
dynamics from childhood might be re-created in adulthood. 

<br><br></p>
<h2>Patterns of relational dynamics</h2>
<p>


  <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/girl_shadow.webp" style="float: left; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">

  Being in a particular relationship dynamic during childhood, when we are vulnerable and dependent on our caregivers, causes us to think in certain ways
and tell ourselves certain things, in order to cope with our situation. What these things are depends on the specific relationship, so let's have a look at an example. 

<br><br>

Imagine a scenario where a young girl and her mother are abused by the mother's boyfriend. The young girl might think <span class="italics">"this isn't
  fair, I don't deserve this. We don't deserve this. Why doesn't my mother protect me?"</span>. But how might that play out in practice? The young girl
  is vulnerable, and fighting back against the boyfriend will cause more conflict, which will make her situation worse, as well as increase her feelings of injustice (which is
  what led to the increased conflict in the first place).
  Additionally, the girl may fear the mother taking the side of the boyfriend, causing the girl to feel isolated and unloved, on top of the feeling that the mother isn't
  providing the sort of protection she might be expected to. So the reasonable view might be disastrous for her. What are some alternatives? 


<br><br>
Since anger would lead to increased resentment and conflict, she needs to protect herself from anger, which means protecting herself from the idea
that things aren't fair. If she is unable to get emotional support, she may also need to protect herself
from the idea that her mother should be doing more to protect or support her, because this will lead to feelings of isolation that she may not feel she can handle alone.
So, she might tell herself,
<span class="italics">"I do deserve to be treated this way"</span>. Suddenly she doesn't need to fight, and reality seems fair and just again. There's no
longer any need to question whether her mother loves her. She might tell herself <span class="italics">"all men are abusive, and we have to get used to it
  or be alone"</span>. Now the girl doesn't need to question her mother's choices, or live with the suffering that we all experience when we hope for a reality
  that we are powerless to bring about. 

<br><br>

There are very strong emotional reasons for these beliefs. They protect the young girl from thoughts and feelings that would lead to her situation getting worse.
<span class="italics bold">They protect her from grief, and from the anger, uncertainty, and loneliness that she feels she is unable to handle by herself.</span>

<br><br></p>
<h2>Re-creating the relationship dynamic through selection</h2>
  <p>

    <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/trapped_maze.webp" style="float: right; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">

    So, what happens when this girl grows up? There are many possibilities. Let's look at just a few.
    
    <br><br>

    She has some strongly held beliefs, which she needed to hold. How do these beliefs shape her adult life? Let's say she
meets a man who shows interest in her, but who doesn't appear to be abusive. What might she think in this situation? <span class="italics">"Since all men are
  abusive, this man must be trying to hide his abusive tendencies. He might be trying to trick me, or he might be so extremely abusive that he needs to hide it"</span>
  is one possibility. <span class="italics">"I deserve to be mistreated. Eventually this man will figure it out and leave me. I can't allow myself to get attached to
  being treated well, because it will feel so much worse when he confirms my belief about myself and leaves"</span> is another possibility.
  <span class="italics">“I am someone with so little value that I deserved to be mistreated, so if this man is kind to me, he must have even less value than I do”</span>
  is another. All of these lead her away from healthy, secure relationships. There are likely other possibilities.


<br><br>

If her deeply held beliefs push her away from healthy, secure relationships, what is left? Men who are like her mother's abusive boyfriend. She has already come
to accept how these men treat her. <span class="italics bold">She knows what will happen, she knows how to respond, and she knows she can live through it.</span>

<br><br>

Alternatively, instead of surrendering to those beliefs which helped her in childhood, she may fight against them. She may say to herself
<span class="italics">"I will never allow myself to be treated like that again"</span>. She may become hypervigilant to signs that she is being mistreated,
and end up with a man who initially shows no signs of anger at all.

<br><br>

However, anger is an indispensible part of being human, and if someone doesn't show any anger at all, it is possible that they are suppressing this anger.
This anger may be channelled inwards, towards the man themselves, and also towards those closest to the man. The woman may get into a long-term relationship
with the man, who may eventually become comfortable enough with the woman that all of his suppressed anger is directed at her.
So this woman may try so hard to avoid being
treated poorly that she ends up with someone who treats her poorly.

<br><br>

<h2>Re-creating the relationship dynamic through elicitation</h2>
<p>
But selecting certain people and rejecting others may not be the only way her childhood experiences shape her present reality. Those experiences can also cause
us to act in ways which elicit certain responses from others. Let's look at this situation a little more deeply.

<br><br>

Ideas like <span class="italics">"all men are abusive, and I need to accept it"</span> and <span class="italics">"I deserve to be mistreated"</span> are
very rigid and absolute. Rigid and absolute ideas
don't tend to hold up well against reality, so in order to hold onto them, we have to actively distort reality. We have to defend the beliefs themselves.
How is this person going to react when they see
a romcom? Or when a friend of theirs appears to be in a healthy relationship? Or when a male co-worker she can't escape from without quitting her job doesn't
appear to be actively malicious? Or when people in general don't treat her poorly?

<br><br>

A person who who holds the <span class="italics">"all men are abusive, we need to accept it, and we deserve it"</span> belief may start to notice that perhaps this
isn't always true. This idea be quite threatening, because it leads to those feelings of grief, anger, and uncertainty, which also seem dangerous.
To defend their belief,
they may cringe at romcoms, try to show their friends how their partners actually are being abusive, and try to expose other men as abusive by goading or taunting them.

<br><br>

If someone instead decides to fight the belief that <span class="italics">"all men are abusive, we need to accept it, and we deserve it"</span>,
they might become so hypervigilant to that sort
of treatment that they begin to see it everywhere. In doing so they re-create that reality in their mind, which may make those around them frustrated and defensive enough
to fit the narrative. They may also attempt to get
revenge on men they meet, beleiving that they are all the same and they all deserve it, which may also elicit aggressive reactions.

<br><br>

We can see how bringing strong expectations into a relationship might create a self-fulfilling prophecy.
There are many other examples of interpersonal expectations shaping outcome which further reinforces expectation. They can also start on the other side
- instead of starting with an environment, leading to an expectation, leading to the re-creation of the environment, the expectation can begin the cycle.
Being thought of as intelligent can improve your performance (this is called the Pygmalion effect). The "researcher allegiance effect" means that results
are more likely to go the way the researcher expects them to. In a remarkable collaboration between a researcher who believed in psychic abilities and one
who did not, the participants tested by the researcher who believed in psychic abilities displayed them, while the participants tested by the other
researcher did not (Wiseman, R., & Schlitz, M. (1997). Experimenter effects and the remote detection of staring.
<span class="italics">Journal of Parapsychology, 61</span>(3), 197-208). Could this perhaps be part of the reason that CBT has so much evidence -
because academics, the ones doing the research studies, people who may happen to enjoy teaching and being logical, might also resonate with a therapeutic
approach that involves teaching people how to be logical? 

<br><br></p>

<h2>The momentum of the belief itself</h2>
<p>
  In the examples I gave in the "Yin and Yang" section,
  people appear to be swinging between opposite ideas or ways of behaving, when there is some denial of need or feeling or response, and the need or feeling of response becomes
  so powerful that it overwhelms the defence against it. When we need to hold onto a rigid idea to protect ourselves from the dangerous feelings we have about reality,
  those feelings may still be building up on some level. Sometimes we may get
  tired, we may start to see the flaws in our
  belief, and the thoughts and feelings we are rejecting might start to build up and break through, causing a shift. Not necessarily in a balanced,
  integrated way, but in a way which can swing in the other direction, where all of our disowned thoughts and feelings from all of our past experiencess come forward,
  not just the ones
  caused by the situation directly in front of us.
  
  <br><br>
  
  In this example, there is anger being kept at bay. What happens when the anger builds up and overpowers the
  <span class="italics">"all men are abusive, we need to accept it, and we deserve it"</span> idea? The person who is the straw that broke the camel's back may have
  a huge amount of anger and aggression directed at them. This person may have done something small, and the response may seem disproportionate. After the woman calms
  down, she may reflect on what she has done and feel guilty. Suddenly it feels like anger is dangerous again, that she can't allow herself to become angry otherwise
  she will be abusive or unreasonable herself. She returns back to the <span class="italics">"all men are abusive, we need to accept it, and we deserve it"</span> idea
  feeling a strong sense of regret that she ever questioned it.

  <br><br>
  
  Why doesn't she just re-evaluate her ideas, that all men are abusive and that she deserves and has to accept being mistreated? Instead of swinging between
  opposing ways of thinking or feeling, why doesn't she begin to believe something that incorporates all of her experiences, something like
  <span class="italics">"some men are as abusive as my mother's boyfriend, some men are more abusive, some men are less abusive. Everyone has the capacity to be harmful
    to others. I don't always have to accept it. It was unfortunate and unfair that I experienced that as a child. I am not dependent anymore, and can choose
    who I spend my time with"</span>?
  
  <br><br>
  
  In her childhood, she didn't feel she could handle grief, anger, and uncertainty. This meant that she needed to protect herself from those
  feelings. In order to protect herself from those feelings, she formed certain ideas, or ways of thinking, or defences, which protected her from her authentic reaction to
  reality. Those ideas or defences can take different forms, but we can see how multiple
  possible forms can still lead her to choose people who repeat the pattern, or how she may unintentionally repeat the pattern by imagining and eliciting the pattern.
  If she has not had a positive experience with the emotions she has been protecting herself from, and if she has successfully re-created her childhood dynamics,
  she may still feel that those emotions are dangerous. She may still feel a need to protect herself with her defences.

  <br><br>

  There is also some degree
  of experimenting with letting go of the belief, which then feels like it backfires and confirms the original belief. In this example and in the examples I
  gave in the "Yin and Yang" section, there is often a combination of these two factors. <span class="italics bold">To some degree the original beliefs may be
  providing protection from ideas
  which will lead to emotions that feel dangerous. To some degree a thought, feeling, or impulse that is suppressed may end up breaking through in an
  unhelpful, intense, and/or inappropriate way, which then confirms the need to suppress it in the first place, maintaining the original belief.</span>
  
  <br><br>
  
  <span class="italics">
  Side note: this may sound similar to Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, in that there is a thesis (belief), an antithesis (opposing belief), and instead of the two coming
  together to create a synthesis (a more comprehensive belief which captures both points of view), there is instead alternating between thesis and antithesis.
  This similarity may be because, in developing Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, Marsha Linehan drew on her intuition, and on Zen Buddhism. When Buddhism initially
  travelled to China, it mingled with Taoism and Confucianism and became Chan Buddhism, which was then taken to Japan to become Zen Buddhism. So the common factor here
  is Taoism.
  </span>
  
  <br><br>
  
  In this example we can see how an environment can lead to some deeply held beliefs, and how those deeply held beliefs might serve to re-create the childhood
  environment in a cyclical pattern. In addition, we can see how the belief itself may alternate between being held comepletely and being rejected completely,
  which is another cycle in itself, and therefore how the concept of yin and yang
  may be fractal, in that each part of a cycle might consist of a smaller cycle.
  
  <br><br>
  
  <span class="italics">
    Second side note: I feel like this may be taken as some form of "victim blaming" by some people. I don't believe this is the case. I see this more as "survivor empowering".
    I don't believe that anyone deserves to be mistreated, and I don't blame anyone. But the reality of our lives is that we cannot control the behaviour of others,
    we cannot control reality, and reality is often unfair. As such,
    any improvement in the way we are treated has to be through looking at what we can do differently. Not through a lens of regret, shame, guilt, judgement, or
    self-criticism, but
    a through a lens of curiousity, compassion, and openness.

<h2>The paradox of yin and yang</h2>
<p>

  <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/soft_hard.webp" style="float: left; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">

I think the concept of yin and yang has even more to add than just the recognition that there are cyclical relationships in many places. Yin and yang
aren't just arbitrary, interchangeable parts of a cycle, they each have their own definition and complex relationship to each other. Yin is defined as
feminine, soft, receptive dark, passive, cold, flexible, yielding, relaxed, and slow. Yang is defined as masculine, hard, productive, light, active, warm,
inflexible, firm, excited, and fast. Both were seen as necessary in the right context, in the way that the yin receptive space of a cup is only useful when
surrounded by the firm yang of the cup's material, and a completely solid yang cup without a receptive yin space would be not useful for purpose. 


<br><br>

Why should we care about the specifics of yin and yang, or how each is defined, or their complex interdependency? This complex interdependency points to a
paradox - yin turns into yang, but also, within yin is a core of yang. This means that in some ways, yin can be more yang than yang is, and vice versa. It
also means that the receptive calm of yin may invite and invigorate the active yang, and the overactive yang may exhaust itself and collapse into yin. 

<br><br>

This concept is illustrated in chapter 36 of the Tao Te Ching, where Lao Tzu said that <span class="italics">"the soft and weak overcome the hard and strong"</span>.
This idea is further expanded in chapter forty three: 

<br><br>
<span class="italics">
The softest thing in the universe<br>
Overcomes the hardest thing in the universe.<br>
That without substance can enter where there is no room.<br>
Hence I know the value of non-action.

<br><br>

Teaching without words and work without doing<br>
Are understood by very few.
</span>
<br><br>

The same point is made again in chapter seventy six: 

<br><br>
<span class="italics">
A man is born gentle and weak.<br>
At his death he is hard and stiff.<br>
Green plants are tender and filled with sap.<br>
At their death they are withered and dry.

<br><br>

Therefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death.<br>
The gentle and yielding is the disciple of life.

<br><br>

Thus an army without flexibility never wins a battle.<br>
A tree that is unbending is easily broken. 

<br><br>

The hard and strong will fall.<br>
The soft and weak will overcome. 
</span>
<br><br>

and again in chapter seventy eight: 

<br><br>
<span class="italics">
Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water.<br>
Yet for attacking the solid and strong, nothing is better;<br>
It has no equal.<br>
The weak can overcome the strong;<br>
The supple can overcome the stiff.<br>
Under heaven everyone knows this,<br>
Yet no one puts it into practice.<br>
Therefore the sage says:<br>
He who takes upon himself the humiliation of the people is fit to rule them.<br>
He who takes upon himself the country's disasters deserves to be king of the universe.<br>
The truth often sounds paradoxical. 
</span>
<br><br>

When we strive to be productive, we can set off hastily and do a bunch of useless or counterproductive things, and be less productive than if we had been more
patient and developed a better understanding of what needs doing, how, and why. When we strive to be too active, we can deprive ourselves of enough recovery,
and end up burning ourselves out. The tale of the tortoise and the hare is based on this same principle. The US Navy seals say that slow is smooth and smooth
is fast. The more we strive for a magic bullet to end our suffering, the more we suffer. The more logical we are, the closer we get to the bedrock of axioms which
are paradoxically irrational. The general form of this idea is that the more we strive for an unnatural level of a particular thing, the more we invite the opposite
of that thing. <span class="italics bold">Could it be possible that the more we cling to a defence (yang) against an environment, the more we invite that environment (yin)?
Or that the more
we try to control (yang) the way we think/feel/act, the more we invite an intense or inappropriate outburst (yin) which leads to exactly the outcome we were trying to avoid
in the first place?</span>

<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Wu Wei</h2>
<p>

  <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/wuwei.webp" style="float: right; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">

  How do we use this new lens to navigate life? The ancient Chinese philosophers also had a concept called Wu Wei. There are many disagreements about what Wu Wei
actually means, as it was originally written about in ancient Chinese. The symbol for Wu (無) means no, not, don't, nobody, or not yet. The symbol for Wei (為)
means to make, to do, to govern, to construct, to become, to act. So there is a negation word, and a word for something that seems to align with the concept of
yang. Wu Wei is often translated as non-action, non-doing, or effortless action, and this is interpreted by some as being in a flow state. My inclination is for a different
interpretation. Lao Tzu said <span class="italics">"know the masculine, but stick to the feminine"</span>. In the examples of paradoxical outcomes above, all which
start with yang backfire, while all which start with yin have pleasant outcomes. In the re-creation of childhood dynamics there is some element of protecting the self
from certain feelings which may have been or may still be overwhelming, and some element of alternating between opposing ideas, or protecting oneself from the unpleasant
parts of opposing ideas.

<br><br>

So maybe we could interpret Wu Wei in a different way. Instead of striving to suppress the thoughts and feelings which arise, we can be open and curious about them. This
means that instead of needing to protect ourselves from certain feelings by clinging to certain thoughts, we can be open to the present, accepting things as they are and embracing
our authentic responses. This "non-doing" may mean that we stop striving to protect ourselves from an environment and in doing so unintentionally
re-create that environment. It may mean we stop striving to protect ourselves from the destructive outcome of a thought or feeling, and in doing so unintentionally
neglect the underlying need that thought or feeling is trying to address to such a degree that it comes out in exactly the destructive way we were striving to prevent. Instead,
we can be open to the reality that exists, open to however we feel about that,
and open to finding some middle ground where we can acknowledge and respect our diverse
needs.

<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Patterns of relational dynamics as yin and yang</h2>
<p>

  <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/trapped_circle.webp" style="float: left; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">

  If we look at repeating relational patterns through this lens, and say that the environment is the yin of a cycle (because it invites certain beliefs), and the
response to the environment is the yang (because it is actively shaping the present), we have multiple possible avenues for change. We can go to a therapist
to create a new, more nurturing environment. We can vividly imagine someone stepping in during pivotal moments in our childhood, giving ourselves permission to
let go of the beliefs we needed when we were dependent and vulnerable (this is called imagery rescripting). We can identify our defences (with or without a
therapist's help), understand them, and let them go. We can slow down the cycle by creating some space between our past and our present, rather than imposing
our past on our present with expectations, and defences against those expectations.


<br><br>

None of this is simple or straightforward, and it's no wonder there is so much resistance, ambiguity, and feelings of being stuck or going backwards
in therapy. Instead of laying out a standardised set of ideas or
instructions and having people follow them, it's more like going inside someone's mind and playing Jenga with all of the beliefs which may be flexible and
easily changed, or may be holding back an immense amount of grief, anger, or uncertainty. 

<br><br>

To add some more depth to this argument, here are some other ways that our response to an environment might cause us to re-create that environment
by eliciting familiar responses from people.

<br><br>

If we expect someone to dislike us, we may try to protect ourselves from the hurt and embarrassment of this by acting cold, defensive, aloof, or actively
demonstrating a dislike for the other person. The result is often that the person ends up not liking us.
At times we might try to be more positive and proactive, but
without much experience behaving this way we may come across as unnatural or forced.

<br><br>

If we grew up in an environment where tasks didn't get done correctly or at all unless we were in control or did the tasks ourselves, we might go through
life expecting this to happen, and being hyper vigilant to tasks not getting done the way we want them to. Others may notice that we have usually already
thought of everything, or done everything really well. Others may notice that when they try to do a task, we are critical of the way it was done, and re-do
it ourselves. They may start to expect that we will do things ourselves, that we prefer it that way, and that doing something for us will just cause conflict,
leading them to do less for us, and to forget how to
do things the way we want them to. The end result is that we have recreated a situation where tasks won't get done correctly or at all, unless we are in control.
At times we might long for someone to take care of tasks for us, but without having done this in the past we may become quickly irritated by
their relative incompetence.

<br><br>

If we expect people will respond unhelpfully to our expressions of emotion, we might try to hide, or suppress/repress our emotions, until they become too
strong to contain. They might come out in uncontrolled, intense ways, causing others to respond unhelpfully.

<br><br>

If we have been bullied or criticised a lot, we may expect this from others. This may cause us to be hyper vigilant to possible insults or criticism in the
future. We may become easily defensive or hostile, which may aggravate others and elicit hostility or criticism in response. 
At times we might feel isolated or lonely, and yearn to be vulnerable with someone, but if everyone seems equally hostile we may have a hard time
picking someone who will respond helpfully.

<br><br>

If we have been let down a lot in the past, we may come to expect that we will continue to be let down. We may stop communicating our preferences or needs.
At times we may start to get our hopes up about someone not letting us down, but instead of the reasonable expectations of others that may have developed if
we had experienceed years of assertive compromise, it is a more idealistic hope. An idealistic hope in the context of not having expressed preferences or needs
will often lead to more disappointment.


<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Transference and countertransference</h2>
<p>

  <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/therapy_room.webp" style="float: right; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">

  Lastly, cylical relationship between the environment and the effects of the environment can be a source of useful information in therapy, through an
analysis of transference and countertransference. The interpersonal expectations that the client brings to therapy can give an indication of how the client
may have been treated in the past. The way the therapist emotionally responds to the client may give clues as to how the client might be subconsciously
eliciting a response from other people, what this response may be, and how the client may be eliciting it. If people in the client's life
react or treat the client in a certain way, and that response is elicited consciously or subconsciously by the client as part of a longstanding
relational dynamic, that response may mirror how the client was treated early in their life. 


<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>

  <img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/dove_release.webp" style="float: left; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">

  Introducing the concept of yin and yang to this discussion doesn't necessarily help us to understand the underlying mechanics. The mechanics involved in the
cycle of sunshine and rainfall are different from the ones involved in the cycle of bingeing and purging. However, introducing the concept of yin and yang
can encourage us to understand not just the symptom, but how the symptom might fit into a broader cycle, how the symptom might exist as a cycle itself,
and how directly trying to reduce something might paradoxically result in the opposite outcome. 


<br><br>

If we can start to recognise the complex interdependency between our environment, expectations, defenses, and what those defences may be currently protecting
us from, we can begin to break free from the unconscious re-creation of our past experiences in our present relationships. We can see how we have been locked in place
by an environment, and by certain defences against that environment, which continuously reinforce each other. We can find a way to open ourselves up to the
grief, the anger, and the uncertainty that comes when we let go of those defences. As Rumi said,
<span class="italics">“your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.”</span>

<br><br>

A therapist might be able to assist in creating this environment, or in identifying and supporting the release of the defences, but this is not the only path
forward. By cultivating self-awareness, self-compassion, and a willingness to engage in honest self-inquiry, we can begin to reshape our internal and relational dynamics.

<br><br>

What do we expect from others, and of ourselves? How does this change how we interpret things, how we treat others, and how we treat ourselves?
Are there things we feel that we need to believe? Are there things we feel that we couldn't possibly believe? What might happen if those beliefs
were to change - what would we feel? Would we be able to cope with that feeling? Are we alternating between opposing ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving?

<br><br>

The framework in this article is actually consistent with a number of different therapeutic paradigms. There is the identification of beliefs and perpetuating factors
from CBT, there is acceptance of reality from ACT, there is the unburdening of the pain a part of us is carrying through witnessing and self-compassion from IFS,
there is radical acceptance and the integration of thesis and antithesis from DBT, there is imagery rescripting and the idea of surrendering or
overcompensating towards core beliefs from
schema therapy, and there is the identification and release of defence mechanisms from psychodynamics.

<br><br>

I think it's quite possible that, since all therapeutic approaches are aimed at the same thing, human suffering, perhaps they are all looking at different parts of the same process,
and using different names for each of the parts.
