          This article is about something very strange. Have you ever noticed that people often end up in relationships or friendships with people similar to a parent, or playing a role similar to the one they played as a child? A person who was mistreated by their parents as a child ends up dating people who mistreat them. A person who looked after their parents as a child ends up looking after people as a grown up. A person who was picked on and bullied as a child ends up in lots of conflict and fights as an adult. A person who was neglected as a child by emotionally distant parents ends up with someone who is neglectful and emotionally distant. A child who grew up in an environment where there was a lot of comparison and competition between the siblings ends up in a career that involves a lot of comparison and competition. 

<img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/mirrors.webp" style="float: left; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">

<br><br>

Freud called this "repetition compulsion". There are a few different theories on why this happens. One theory is that the subconscious mind is trying to
signal to the conscious mind that there is subconscious material that needs to be processed. Another theory is that the individual is subconsciously trying
to "master" the situation. There is also the idea that people are drawn to relationships which are familiar. 

<br><br>

There is nothing wrong with any of these ideas, and this article is broadly consistent with them. However I feel like the explanations above don't do much to
tell us "why" this happens. <span class="italics bold">Why can't the individual just leave the pattern of relationships behind - especially when they have
  recognised it and want to change it? </span>

<br><br>

In this article I want to reinterpret the pattern of relational dynamics that people get stuck in through the lens of yin and yang. This is a much more
abstract way of understanding relational patterns, which takes us in the opposite direction, so I also want to look at a few examples and talk about
"why" this happens. So why bring yin and yang into it at all, if it's even more abstract than the current explanations? The concept of yin and yang was
designed to be so abstract that it could be used to explain everything in the universe, which I think is quite elegant, and I also think it can give us
more of an indication of what we can do about it, as well as why it is so hard to change, and may backfire if we try too hard. 

<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Yin and Yang</h2>
<p>
For some background, let me explain the concept of yin and yang. Ancient Chinese philosophers created these terms as a way of describing or understanding
a relationship between two things which create, define, or sustain each other.

<img src="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/assets/yinyang1.webp" style="float: right; max-width: 200px; margin: 10px;">


<br><br>

Everything that exists is brought into existence by something, and the concept of yin and yang implies that this relationship is circular and self sustaining,
rather than linear. For example, children turn into adults, and adults create children. Overgrown bushes create bushfires, which provide the necessary
conditions for dormant seeds to sprout. A clear sky over water creates the conditions for evaporation, leading to a storm, and a storm clears the skies
and returns water to the earth. 

<br><br>

On a psychological level, feelings of inferiority might cause a person to become judgemental of others in order to feel superior. This may push people away,
leading back to feelings of inferiority. A tendency to suppress an emotion might cause a buildup of that emotion, leading to an outburst that the person
feels was inappropriate, which might lead back to suppression. In a relationship, feelings of resentment might build until it leads to intense conflict,
which then might lead to guilt and love bombing, which then prevents the person from addressing their issues in the relationship, leading up further resentment.
In a complex relationship with food, emotional eating or bingeing may lead to guilt and food restriction, which might then lead to increased cravings and distress,
leading to more emotional eating or bingeing. Keeping people at arm's length might lead to loneliness, causing the person to reach out to an inappropriate person
or in an inappropriate way, leading to a distressing experience and back to keeping people at arm's length. Self criticism may lead to feeling defeated,
discouraged, and hopeless, which may lead to reduced achievement and more self criticism. 

<br><br>

So we can see that many things form self-sustaining cycles. Let's now briefly leave the concept of yin and yang, to look more closely at how relational
dynamics from childhood might be recreated in adulthood. 

<br><br></p>
<h2>Patterns of relational dynamics</h2>
<p>
Being in a particular relationship dynamic during childhood, when we are vulnerable and dependent on our caregivers, causes us to think in certain ways
and tell ourselves certain things, in order to cope with our situation. What these things are depends on the specific relationship, so let's have a look at an example. 

<br><br>

Imagine a scenario where a young girl and her mother are abused by the mother's boyfriend. The young girl might think <span class="italics">"this isn't
  fair, I don't deserve this. We don't deserve this. Why doesn't my mother protect me?"</span>. But how might that play out in practice? The young girl
  is vulnerable, and fighting back against the boyfriend will cause more conflict, which will make her situation worse, increasing her feelings of injustice.
  Additionally, the mother may take the side of the boyfriend, causing the girl to feel isolated and unloved, on top of the feeling that the mother isn't
  providing the sort of protection she might be expected to. So the reasonable view might be disastrous for her. What are some alternatives? 

<br><br>

She needs to protect herself from the idea that things aren't fair, because this leads to increased conflict and resentment. She also needs to protect herself
from the idea that her mother should be doing more to protect her, because this will make her feel even more isolated. So, she might tell herself,
<span class="italics">"I do deserve to be treated this way"</span>. Suddenly she doesn't need to fight, and reality seems fair and just again. There's no
longer any need to question whether her mother loves her. She might tell herself <span class="italics">"all men are abusive, and we have to get used to it
  or be alone"</span>. Now the girl doesn't need to question her mother's choices, or live with the suffering that comes from hoping for a different reality
  that we are powerless to bring about. 

<br><br>

There are very strong emotional reasons for these beliefs. They protect the young girl from thoughts and feelings that would lead to her situation getting worse.
<span class="italics bold">They protect her from grief, rage, and uncertainty.</span>

<br><br></p>
<h2>Re-creating the relationship dynamic</h2>
  <p>
So, what happens when this girl grows up? She has some strongly held beliefs, which she needed to hold. How do these beliefs shape her adult life? Let's say she
meets a man who shows interest in her, but who doesn't appear to be abusive. What might she think in this situation? <span class="italics">"Since all men are
  abusive, this man must be trying to hide his abusive tendencies. He might be trying to trick me, or he might be so extremely abusive that he needs to hide it"</span>
  is one possibility. <span class="italics">"I deserve to be mistreated. Eventually this man will figure it out and leave me. I can't allow myself to get attached to
  being treated well, because it will feel so much worse when he confirms my belief about myself and leaves"</span> is another possibility.
  <span class="italics">“I am someone with so little value that I deserved to be mistreated, so if this man is kind to me, he must have even less value than I do”</span>
  is another. All of these lead her away from healthy, secure relationships. There are likely other possibilities.

<br><br>

If her deeply held beliefs push her away from healthy, secure relationships, what is left? Men who are like her mother's abusive boyfriend. She has already come
to accept how these men treat her. <span class="italics bold">She knows what will happen, she knows how to respond, and she knows she can live through it.</span>

<br><br>

Why doesn't she just reevaluate her ideas, that all men are abusive and that she deserves to be mistreated? That would mean reinterpreting all of her childhood
experiences - <span class="italics bold">it would mean accepting the uncertainty of an unfair world, it would mean grieving for the child who was so badly treated,
  and it would mean feeling anger and betrayal towards her mother</span>. Additionally, if this girl has successfully recreated her childhood relationship dynamics,
  she may not feel like she has the resilience or emotional support to go through that grieving process, or to feel like she can question or potentially give up
  the only relationship she has which feels loving. 

<br><br>

In this example we can see how an environment can lead to some deeply held beliefs, and how those deeply held beliefs might serve to recreate the childhood
environment in a cyclical pattern.

<br><br></p>
<h2>The paradox of yin and yang</h2>
<p>
But I think the concept of yin and yang has even more to add than just the recognition that there are cyclical relationships in many places. Yin and yang
aren't just arbitrary, interchangeable parts of a cycle, they each have their own definition and complex relationship to each other. Yin is defined as
feminine, soft, receptive dark, passive, cold, flexible, yielding, relaxed, and slow. Yang is defined as masculine, hard, productive, light, active, warm,
inflexible, firm, excited, and fast. Both were seen as necessary in the right context, in the way that the yin receptive space of a cup is only useful when
surrounded by the firm yang of the cup's material, and a completely solid yang cup without a receptive yin space would be not useful for purpose. 

<br><br>

Why should we care about the specifics of yin and yang, or how each is defined, or their complex interdependency? This complex interdependency points to a
paradox - yin turns into yang, but also, within yin is a core of yang. This means that in some ways, yin can be more yang than yang is, and vice versa. It
also means that the receptive calm of yin may invite and invigorate the active yang, and the overactive yang may exhaust itself and collapse into yin. 

<br><br>

This concept is illustrated in chapter 36 of the Tao Te Ching, where Lao Tzu said that <span class="italics">"the soft and weak overcome the hard and strong"</span>.
This idea is further expanded in chapter forty three: 

<br><br>
<span class="italics">
The softest thing in the universe<br>
Overcomes the hardest thing in the universe.<br>
That without substance can enter where there is no room.<br>
Hence I know the value of non-action.

<br><br>

Teaching without words and work without doing<br>
Are understood by very few.
</span>
<br><br>

The same point is made again in chapter seventy six: 

<br><br>
<span class="italics">
A man is born gentle and weak.<br>
At his death he is hard and stiff.<br>
Green plants are tender and filled with sap.<br>
At their death they are withered and dry.

<br><br>

Therefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death.<br>
The gentle and yielding is the disciple of life.

<br><br>

Thus an army without flexibility never wins a battle.<br>
A tree that is unbending is easily broken. 

<br><br>

The hard and strong will fall.<br>
The soft and weak will overcome. 
</span>
<br><br>

and again in chapter seventy eight: 

<br><br>
<span class="italics">
Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water.<br>
Yet for attacking the solid and strong, nothing is better;<br>
It has no equal.<br>
The weak can overcome the strong;<br>
The supple can overcome the stiff.<br>
Under heaven everyone knows this,<br>
Yet no one puts it into practice.<br>
Therefore the sage says:<br>
He who takes upon himself the humiliation of the people is fit to rule them.<br>
He who takes upon himself the country's disasters deserves to be king of the universe.<br>
The truth often sounds paradoxical. 
</span>
<br><br>

When we strive to be productive, we can set off hastily and do a bunch of useless or counterproductive things, and be less productive than if we had been more
patient and developed a better understanding of what needs doing, how, and why. When we strive to be too active, we can deprive ourselves of enough recovery,
and end up burning ourselves out. The tale of the tortoise and the hare is based on this same principle. The US Navy seals say that slow is smooth and smooth
is fast. The more we strive for a magic bullet to end our suffering, the more we suffer. The more logical we are, the closer we get to the bedrock of axioms which
are paradoxically irrational. The general form of this idea is that the more we strive for an unnatural level of a particular thing, the more we invite the opposite
of that thing. Could it be possible that the more we cling to a defence (yang) against an environment, the more we invite that environment (yin)? 

<br><br>

In the example above, the girl's environment was a place that invited her to view things a certain way. This invitation, creating a space for a specific thing,
is a yin characteristic. The active defences against this environment, which serve to shape future relationships, are a yang characteristic. 

<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Wu Wei</h2>
<p>
How do we use this new lens to navigate life? The ancient Chinese philosophers also had a concept called Wu Wei. There are many disagreements about what Wu Wei
actually means, as it was originally written about in ancient Chinese. The symbol for Wu (無) means no, not, don't, nobody, or not yet. The symbol for Wei (為)
means to make, to do, to govern, to construct, to become, to act. So there is a negation word, and a word for something that seems to align with the concept of
yang. Wu Wei is often translated as non action or effortless action, and this is interpreted by some as being in a flow state. My inclination is for a different
interpretation. Lao Tzu said <span class="italics">"know the masculine, but stick to the feminine"</span>. In the examples of paradoxical outcomes above, all which
start with yang backfire, while all which start with yin have pleasant outcomes. So I believe that the concept of Wu Wei is more accurately captured by the idea that,
if it is true that there is a natural dynamic equilibrium in many different domains, striving to go against the natural course of events leads to paradoxical and
unintended outcomes. On the other hand, being open, receptive, and flexible allows you to take things as they come. Therefore, if we can respond to the present
moment, rather than imposing our past on the present moment through predictions and defences, we might be able to avoid shaping the present moment into the image of the past. 

<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Patterns of relational dynamics as yin and yang</h2>
<p>
If we look at repeating relational patterns through this lens, and say that the environment is the yin of a cycle (because it invites certain beliefs), and the
defence against the environment is the yang (because it is actively shaping the present), we have multiple possible avenues for change. We can go to a therapist
to create a new, more nurturing environment. We can vividly imagine someone stepping in during pivotal moments in our childhood, giving ourselves permission to
let go of the beliefs we needed when we were dependent and vulnerable (this is called imagery rescripting). We can identify our defences (with or without a
therapist's help), understand them, and let them go. We can slow down the cycle by creating some space between our past and our present, rather than imposing
our past on our present with expectations, and defences against those expectations. 

<br><br>

None of this is simple or straightforward, and it's no wonder there is so much resistance in therapy. Instead of laying out a standardised set of ideas or
instructions and having people follow them, it's more like going inside someone's mind and playing Jenga with all of the beliefs which may be flexible and
easily changed, or may be holding back an immense amount of grief, rage, or uncertainty. 

<br><br>

However, avoiding certain people in favour of others isn't the only way that relationship patterns persist. People can also consciously or subconsciously
elicit certain responses from people which align with their expectations or past experiences.

<br><br>

If we expect someone to dislike us, we may try to protect ourselves from the hurt and embarrassment of this by acting cold, defensive, aloof, or actively
demonstrating a dislike for the other person. The result is often that the person ends up not liking us.

<br><br>

If we grew up in an environment where tasks didn't get done correctly or at all unless we were in control or did the tasks ourselves, we might go through
life expecting this to happen, and being hyper vigilant to tasks not getting done the way we want them to. Others may notice that we have usually already
thought of everything, or done everything really well. Others may notice that when they try to do a task, we are critical of the way it was done, and re-do
it ourselves. They may start to expect that we will do things ourselves, and that we prefer it that way, leading them to do less for us, and forget how to
do things the way we want them to. The end result is that we have recreated a situation where tasks won't get done correctly or at all, unless we are in control. 

<br><br>

If we expect people will respond unhelpfully to our expressions of emotion, we might try to hide, or suppress/repress our emotions, until they become too
strong to contain. They might come out in uncontrolled, intense ways, causing others to respond unhelpfully. 

<br><br>

If we have been bullied or criticised a lot, we may expect this from others. This may cause us to be hyper vigilant to possible insults or criticism in the
future. We may become easily defensive or hostile, which may aggravate others and elicit hostility or criticism in response. 

<br><br>

There are many other cycles like this, examples of expectation shaping outcome which further reinforces expectation. They can also start on the other side
- instead of starting with an environment, leading to an expectation, leading to the re-creation of the environment, the expectation can begin the cycle.
Being thought of as intelligent can improve your performance (this is called the Pygmalion effect). The "researcher allegiance effect" means that results
are more likely to go the way the researcher expects them to. In a remarkable collaboration between a researcher who believed in psychic abilities and one
who did not, the participants tested by the researcher who believed in psychic abilities displayed them, while the participants tested by the other
researcher did not (Wiseman, R., & Schlitz, M. (1997). Experimenter effects and the remote detection of staring.
<span class="italics">Journal of Parapsychology, 61</span>(3), 197-208). Could this perhaps be part of the reason that CBT has so much evidence -
because academics, the ones doing the research studies, people who may happen to enjoy teaching and being logical, might also resonate with a therapeutic
approach that involves teaching people how to be logical? 

<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Transference and countertransference</h2>
<p>
Lastly, this tendency to cycle between the environment and the effects of the environment can be a source of useful information in therapy, through an
analysis of transference and countertransference. The interpersonal expectations that the client brings to therapy can give an indication of how the client
may have been treated in the past. The way the therapist emotionally responds to the client may give clues as to how the client might be subconsciously
eliciting a response from other people, and what this response may be. If people in the client's life react or treat the client in a certain way, and that
response is elicited consciously or subconsciously by the client as part of a longstanding relational dynamic, the response may mirror how the client was
treated early in their life. 

<br><br>
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Introducing the concept of yin and yang to this discussion doesn't necessarily help us to understand the underlying mechanics. The mechanics involved in the
cycle of sunshine and rainfall are different from the ones involved in the cycle of bingeing and purging. However, introducing the concept of yin and yang
can encourage us to understand not just the symptom, but how the symptom might fit into a broader cycle, and how directly trying to reduce something might
paradoxically result in the opposite outcome. 

<br><br>

If we can start to recognise the complex interdependency between our environment, expectations, defenses, and what those defences may be currently protecting
us from, we can begin to break free from the unconscious recreation of our past experiences in our present relationships. We can see how we are locked in place
by an environment, and by certain defences against that environment, which continuously reinforce each other. We can find a way to open ourselves up to the
grief, the rage, and the uncertainty that comes when we let go of those defences. As Rumi said,
<span class="italics">“your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.”</span>

<br><br>

A therapist might be able to assist in creating this environment, or in identifying and supporting the release of the defences, but is not the only path
forward. By cultivating self-awareness, self-compassion, and a willingness to engage in honest self-inquiry, we can begin to reshape our relational dynamics
and break free from the cycles that have held us back. 

<br><br>

Ultimately, the insights offered by the concept of yin and yang invite us to approach our relationships and personal growth with a new level of understanding
and intentionality. By embracing the wisdom of this ancient philosophy, we can work towards creating more harmonious, fulfilling, and authentic connections
with ourselves and others.
