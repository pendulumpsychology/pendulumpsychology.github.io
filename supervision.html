                <h2>My Approach to Supervision</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Perhaps you've noticed moments in therapy that stir something in you - uncertainty about what's happening, feelings you weren't expecting, situations that leave you wondering. Maybe you find yourself thinking about certain clients between sessions, or noticing patterns in your work that you'd like to understand better.
                    <br><br>
                    You might be seeking supervision for many reasons. Perhaps you want support in navigating complex clinical situations. You might be looking for a space to process the emotional impact of this work. Maybe you're curious about developing your therapeutic voice, or wondering how to work more deeply with your clients. You might simply feel that something is missing in your clinical work, even if you can't quite name what it is.
                    <br><br>
                    Just as our clients need safety to explore their inner world, we as therapists need a space where we can share our thoughts and feelings about our work without fear of judgement. When we create this kind of environment, authentic expression becomes possible. Through authentic expression, we naturally develop greater self-awareness and reflectivity, allowing our unique therapeutic voice to emerge organically.
                    <br><br>
                    Whatever brings you to supervision, I aim to meet you where you are and let your interests and questions guide our work together. Rather than imposing a predetermined structure, I prefer to create an open space where our exploration can unfold naturally in whatever direction feels most meaningful to you.
                    <br><br>
                    While my own background includes interests in relational patterns and the deeper emotional currents that often lie beneath the surface of our clinical work, I hold these lightly - they inform my curiosity and questions rather than dictating our approach. Our work together will focus on what you're discovering in your clinical practice and how you want to grow as a therapist.
                </p>
