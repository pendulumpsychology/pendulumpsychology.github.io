Chapter 1:
Original Chinese text:

道可道，非常道。名可名，非常名。無名天地之始；有名萬物之母。故常無欲，以觀其妙；常有欲，以觀其徼。此兩者，同出而異名，同謂之玄。玄之又玄，眾妙之門。

My translation:

The Tao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
The named is the mother of all things.
Therefore, always without desire, observe the subtle essence.
And with desire, observe the manifestations.
These two emerge together but differ in name.
Both are called the mystery.
Mystery upon mystery,
The gateway to all wonders.

Commentary:

This opening chapter of the Tao Te Ching introduces the concept of the Tao (道), which is an essential principle of Taoism. The Tao is often translated as "the Way" or "the Path," but it is much more than that. It is an all-encompassing, transcendent principle that underlies the universe and everything in it. The Tao is both the origin and the sustainer of all that exists.

The first lines of the chapter emphasize that the true nature of the Tao cannot be fully grasped or articulated in words or names, as it is beyond human comprehension. The Tao is described as both nameless (無名) and named (有名). The nameless represents the unmanifested potential, the source of all creation, and the eternal essence of the universe. The named, on the other hand, refers to the manifested reality, the countless forms and phenomena that arise from the nameless Tao.

The chapter also introduces the concept of desire (欲), which can be understood as an attachment to the material world or the craving for specific outcomes. By cultivating a state of non-attachment or "no desire" (無欲), one can observe the subtle essence of the Tao, while being attached to desires allows one to see the manifestations of the Tao in the world of forms.

The text emphasizes that both the nameless and named, the subtle and the manifest, arise from the same source, but they are referred to by different names. They are both mysteries (玄) in themselves, and this mystery upon mystery is the gateway to understanding the profound wisdom and wonders of the Tao.

Chapter 2:
Original Chinese text:

天下皆知美之為美，斯惡已。皆知善之為善，斯不善已。故有無相生，難易相成，長短相形，高下相傾，音聲相和，前後相隨。是以聖人處無為之事，行不言之教；萬物作焉而不辭，生而不有。為而不恃，功成而弗居。夫唯弗居，是以不去。

My translation:

All under heaven know beauty as beauty, and thus ugliness arises.
All know goodness as goodness, and thus evil arises.
Therefore, being and non-being create each other,
Difficult and easy complete each other,
Long and short shape each other,
High and low lean on each other,
Tone and voice harmonize with each other,
Front and back follow each other.
Thus, the wise person engages in effortless action,
Teaching without words.
All things arise and they do not claim them,
They bring forth life but do not possess it.
They act without reliance,
Their work accomplished, they do not dwell on it.
For only by not dwelling, can they not depart.

Commentary:

Chapter 2 of the Tao Te Ching emphasizes the interdependence and relativity of opposites in the world. The text suggests that the concepts of beauty and ugliness, goodness and evil, and other pairs of opposites arise from each other. This is an expression of the principle of Yin and Yang, which is central to Taoist philosophy. It conveys the idea that the natural world is a complex web of interconnected and interdependent phenomena.

The chapter also introduces the concept of "effortless action" (無為, wu wei), which is a key aspect of Taoist practice. The wise person, or the sage, is guided by the Tao and engages in actions that are in harmony with the natural flow of the universe. They teach without words, meaning that they lead by example, demonstrating wisdom and virtue through their actions rather than through verbal instruction.

The sage allows all things to arise and does not claim ownership or possession of them. They are able to act without reliance on the outcome or the fruits of their actions. Once their work is accomplished, they do not dwell on it or become attached to their achievements. By not dwelling on their accomplishments, they can maintain a state of detachment and remain in harmony with the Tao. This attitude allows them to remain open to new experiences and insights, ensuring that they do not become stagnant or stuck in their ways.

Chapter 3:
Original Chinese text:

不尚賢，使民不爭；不貴難得之貨，使民不為盜；不見可欲，使民心不亂。是以聖人之治，虛其心，實其腹，弱其志，強其骨。常使民無知無欲。使夫智者不敢為也。為無為，則無不治。

My translation:

Do not exalt the wise, so that people will not compete.
Do not value rare treasures, so that people will not steal.
Do not display objects of desire, so that people's hearts will not be disturbed.
Therefore, the wise ruler:
Empties their mind, fills their belly,
Weakens their ambition, strengthens their bones.
Always keeping the people ignorant and desireless.
This ensures that the clever ones dare not act.
By practicing non-action, everything is governed.

Commentary:

Chapter 3 of the Tao Te Ching offers guidance on governance and leadership, emphasizing the importance of simplicity, contentment, and non-action (無為, wu wei) in creating a harmonious society.

The text advises against exalting the wise or valuing rare treasures, as these actions can lead to competition, theft, and unrest among the people. Instead, the wise ruler focuses on ensuring that the basic needs of the people are met (filling their bellies) and that they are content with what they have. By avoiding the display of wealth or other objects of desire, the ruler prevents the people's hearts from being disturbed by craving and attachment.

The wise ruler also aims to keep the people in a state of simplicity and contentment, free from excessive knowledge and desires that could lead to unrest or manipulative behavior. This approach to governance ensures that even the most clever and ambitious individuals will not dare to exploit others or disrupt the harmony of society.

In practicing non-action (無為, wu wei), the wise ruler allows the natural order of things to govern, thus creating a society that is peaceful, stable, and harmonious. By following the principles of the Tao, the ruler can lead their people without imposing force or control, allowing for the organic development of a well-functioning society.

Chapter 4:
Original Chinese text:

道沖而用之或不盈。淵兮似萬物之宗；挫其銳，解其紛，和其光，同其塵。湛兮似或存。吾不知誰之子，象帝之先。

My translation:

The Tao is like an empty vessel, yet when used, it cannot be exhausted.
Deep and profound, it seems to be the origin of all things.
Blunt the sharpness, untangle the knots,
Soften the glare, merge with the dust.
Mysterious and deep, it seems to eternally exist.
I do not know whose child it is,
It appears to be older than the Emperor.

Commentary:

Chapter 4 of the Tao Te Ching explores the inexhaustible nature of the Tao and its role as the source of all existence.

The Tao is described as an empty vessel, signifying its boundless potential and capacity to give without ever being depleted. This image conveys the idea that the Tao is an eternal and inexhaustible source of life and sustenance, providing for all things without ever running out.

The chapter also emphasizes the depth and profoundness of the Tao, likening it to a deep abyss that seems to be the origin of all things. The text suggests that the Tao is a primordial force that predates even the most ancient and powerful beings, including the Emperor, who was considered the highest authority in ancient China.

The chapter further provides guidance on how to align oneself with the nature of the Tao, by blunting sharpness, untangling knots, softening glare, and merging with the dust. These actions represent the cultivation of humility, patience, gentleness, and simplicity, which are essential qualities for harmonizing with the Tao and achieving inner peace.

By contemplating the mysterious and eternal nature of the Tao, one can gain a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all things and the boundless potential that lies within the natural world and within oneself.

Chapter 5:
Original Chinese text:

天地不仁，以萬物為芻狗；聖人不仁，以百姓為芻狗。天地之間，其猶橐籥乎？虛而不屈，動而愈出。多言數窮，不如守中。

My translation:

Heaven and Earth are impartial; they treat all beings as straw dogs.
The wise person is impartial; they treat all people as straw dogs.
Between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet never collapsing, moving yet always producing.
The more words and speech, the less they accomplish.
Better to hold fast to the centre.

Commentary:

Chapter 5 of the Tao Te Ching presents the idea of impartiality in both the natural world and the behavior of the wise person. It uses the metaphor of "straw dogs" (芻狗) to emphasize the impartiality of Heaven and Earth, as well as the wise person.

In ancient China, straw dogs were used as ceremonial offerings and were discarded after the rituals. The metaphor serves to illustrate the transient nature of life and the importance of non-attachment. Heaven and Earth are indifferent to the lives of individual beings, just as the wise person remains detached from the affairs of people. This impartiality is not cruel or heartless; it represents the natural flow of life and the cycles of birth, growth, and decay.

The chapter also compares the space between Heaven and Earth to a bellows, an instrument that is empty yet never collapses, and moves yet always produces air. This metaphor highlights the inexhaustible nature of the Tao, which is present in the emptiness and movement of the universe.

The text concludes with a caution against excessive speech and action. It suggests that focusing on many words and actions can lead to exhaustion and ineffectiveness, whereas holding fast to the centre – maintaining balance and harmony with the Tao – is a more effective way to navigate life.

By understanding and embodying the principles of impartiality, non-attachment, and balance, one can align themselves with the natural order of the universe and cultivate wisdom and inner peace.

Chapter 6:
Original Chinese text:

谷神不死，是謂玄牝。玄牝之門，是謂天地根。綿綿若存，用之不勤。

My translation:

The spirit of the valley never dies; it is called the mysterious female.
The gate of the mysterious female is the root of Heaven and Earth.
Endlessly enduring, as if it always exists.
Use it, and there is no need to strive.

Commentary:

Chapter 6 of the Tao Te Ching introduces the concept of the "mysterious female" (玄牝), which represents the spirit of the valley or the source of life. In Taoist philosophy, the valley symbolizes the feminine principle of receptivity and nurturing, associated with the element of Yin. The spirit of the valley is eternal, never ceasing to exist, and is considered the source of life-giving energy.

The text further explains that the gate of the mysterious female is the root of Heaven and Earth. This suggests that the feminine principle, as embodied by the spirit of the valley, is the foundation of the natural world and the underlying force that sustains all life.

The chapter also emphasizes the eternal endurance of the mysterious female and its ever-present nature. When aligned with this principle, there is no need to strive or struggle, as one can tap into the inexhaustible source of life and energy it provides.

By recognizing the importance of the feminine principle and the spirit of the valley, one can gain a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all life and the nurturing force that sustains it. Embracing this principle allows for a more harmonious and balanced approach to life, in which striving and struggle are replaced by receptivity and attunement to the natural flow of the universe.

Chapter 7:
Original Chinese text:

天長地久。天地所以能長且久者，以其不自生，故能長生。是以聖人後其身而身先；外其身而身存。非以其無私耶？故能成其私。

My translation:

Heaven and Earth are eternal.
The reason Heaven and Earth can be eternal is that they do not live for themselves; thus, they can endure forever.
Therefore, the wise person puts their self last and yet comes first,
Places their self outside and yet their self survives.
Is it not because they are selfless that they can achieve their own desires?

Commentary:

Chapter 7 of the Tao Te Ching examines the eternal nature of Heaven and Earth and the importance of selflessness in cultivating wisdom and harmony with the Tao.

The text emphasizes that the reason Heaven and Earth can endure forever is that they do not exist for themselves. Instead, they serve as the foundation for all life and the natural order of the universe. This selflessness allows them to remain eternal and unchanging.

Taking inspiration from the selflessness of Heaven and Earth, the wise person cultivates a similar attitude. They put their own self-interests last and prioritize the well-being of others. As a result, they pendulumically achieve their own desires and ensure their own well-being. By placing their self outside of their primary concerns, they ultimately ensure their self survives.

This chapter teaches that by embracing selflessness and putting the needs of others first, one can align with the natural order of the universe and attain harmony with the Tao. In doing so, the individual ultimately benefits, as their actions are in harmony with the selfless, eternal nature of Heaven and Earth.

Chapter 8:
Original Chinese text:

上善若水。水善利萬物而不爭，處衆人之所惡，故幾於道。居善地，心善淵，與善仁，言善信，正善治，事善能，動善時。夫唯不爭，故無尤。

My translation:

The supreme good is like water.
Water benefits all things and does not compete with them.
It dwells in places that people dislike; thus, it is close to the Tao.
In dwelling, be close to the land;
In meditation, go deep in the heart;
In dealing with others, be gentle and kind;
In speech, be true and sincere;
In ruling, be just and fair;
In business, be competent and capable;
In action, move in the right time.
It is because one does not compete that there is no blame.

Commentary:

Chapter 8 of the Tao Te Ching highlights the qualities of water as a metaphor for the supreme good and the ideal way of living in harmony with the Tao.

Water is an essential element of life, nourishing and benefiting all things without competing with them or seeking any reward. It also flows to the lowest places, which people often avoid, illustrating humility and adaptability. These qualities make water an apt metaphor for the Tao and the proper way of life.

The chapter offers guidance on various aspects of life, drawing inspiration from the qualities of water. It encourages being grounded and connected to the land, cultivating depth and stillness in the heart, and showing kindness and compassion in relationships. It also emphasizes the importance of sincerity in speech, fairness in governance, competence in work, and acting at the right time.

By adopting these water-like qualities and not competing with others, one can live without blame and in harmony with the natural order of the universe. This way of living embodies the principles of the Tao and leads to a fulfilling and balanced life.

Chapter 9:
Original Chinese text:

持而盈之，不如其已；揣而銳之，不可常保。金玉滿堂，莫之能守；富貴而驕，自遺其咎。功遂身退天之道。

My translation:

To hold and fill a vessel is not as good as stopping when it is full.
To temper and sharpen a blade, it cannot be preserved forever.
When gold and jade fill the hall, no one can protect them.
Wealth and arrogance bring about one's own downfall.
When your work is accomplished, step back. This is the way of Heaven.

Commentary:

Chapter 9 of the Tao Te Ching offers wisdom on the dangers of excess and the importance of moderation and humility in various aspects of life.

The text begins with the metaphor of a vessel being filled, suggesting that it is better to stop filling when it is full, rather than to keep pouring and risk overflowing. Similarly, when tempering and sharpening a blade, it cannot be preserved indefinitely, as it will eventually wear down and lose its sharpness.

The chapter also warns against the perils of amassing wealth and cultivating arrogance, as these can lead to one's own downfall. When possessions and pride become the focus of one's life, they become difficult to maintain and ultimately lead to loss and suffering.

Instead, the text advises following the way of Heaven: when you have achieved your goals and completed your work, it is essential to step back and let go. This humble approach aligns with the principles of the Tao, fostering balance, contentment, and harmony in life.

By embracing moderation, humility, and non-attachment, one can cultivate a more harmonious and fulfilling existence, in tune with the natural order of the universe.

Chapter 10:
Original Chinese text:

載營魄抱一，能無離乎？專氣致柔，能如嬰兒乎？滌除玄覽，能無疵乎？愛民治國，能無知乎？天門開闔，能為雌乎？明白四達，能無為乎？生之畜之，生而不有，為而不恃，長而不宰，是謂玄德。

My translation:

Can you carry your body and soul, embracing the One, without separation?
Can you concentrate your energy and achieve the softness of an infant?
Can you cleanse your inner vision until it is free from blemishes?
Can you love the people and govern the country without resorting to knowledge?
Can you open and close the gates of Heaven like the female principle?
Can you understand all things and act without taking action?
Giving birth and nourishing, bearing without possessing,
Acting without expectation, leading without dominating;
This is called the mysterious virtue.

Commentary:

Chapter 10 of the Tao Te Ching poses a series of rhetorical questions that encourage introspection and self-cultivation in order to align oneself with the principles of the Tao.

The text challenges the reader to embrace the unity of body and soul, cultivate the softness and flexibility of a child, and purify their inner vision. It also encourages governing with love and compassion, without relying on knowledge or force, and acting in harmony with the natural world without striving or imposing one's will.

The chapter emphasizes the importance of the female principle, which is associated with receptivity, nurturing, and the cycles of birth and death. By embracing these qualities, one can achieve a state of harmony and balance that is in tune with the Tao.

The mysterious virtue (玄德) mentioned in the text refers to the cultivation of these qualities and the embodiment of the principles of the Tao in one's daily life. By nurturing without possessing, acting without expecting, and leading without dominating, one can align with the Tao and cultivate a life of harmony, balance, and fulfillment.

Chapter 11:
Original Chinese text:

三十輻共一轂，當其無，有車之用。埏埴以為器，當其無，有器之用。鑿戶牖以為室，當其無，有室之用。故有之以為利，無之以為用。

My translation:

Thirty spokes join together at one hub.
It is the emptiness in the centre that makes the wheel useful.
Clay is shaped into a vessel.
It is the emptiness inside that makes the vessel useful.
Doors and windows are cut to make a room.
It is the emptiness within that makes the room useful.
Therefore, having things is beneficial, but their emptiness is what makes them useful.

Commentary:

Chapter 11 of the Tao Te Ching explores the concept of emptiness and its importance in giving value and utility to various objects and structures.

The text uses three metaphors to illustrate this concept: the wheel, the vessel, and the room. In each case, it is the emptiness at the centre that makes the object useful. The empty space within the wheel allows it to turn, the empty space within the vessel allows it to hold things, and the empty space within the room allows it to provide shelter and accommodate people.

This chapter highlights the value of emptiness, not only in the physical world but also in our mental and emotional lives. Embracing emptiness allows for flexibility, adaptability, and the capacity to receive and respond to the ever-changing circumstances of life.

By understanding the importance of emptiness, one can cultivate a balanced and harmonious existence that is in tune with the natural order of the universe. Recognizing that it is the emptiness that gives utility to the things we have, we can learn to value both the presence and the absence in our lives.

Chapter 12:
Original Chinese text:

五色令人目盲；五音令人耳聾；五味令人口爽；馳騁畋獵，令人心發狂；難得之貨，令人行妨。是以聖人為腹不為目，故去彼取此。

My translation:

The five colours blind the eyes;
The five tones deafen the ears;
The five flavours dull the palate;
Racing and hunting drive the heart mad;
Hard-to-obtain goods impede one's progress.
Therefore, the wise person acts for the belly, not for the eyes,
Letting go of that and choosing this.

Commentary:

Chapter 12 of the Tao Te Ching cautions against indulging in sensory pleasures and material possessions, as they can distract and hinder one's spiritual development and connection with the Tao.

The text references the five colours, tones, and flavours, which represent the range of sensory experiences that can overwhelm and blind us to the subtler aspects of life. The pursuit of these pleasures can lead to attachment, craving, and dissatisfaction, making it difficult to maintain inner balance and tranquility.

The chapter also warns against the dangers of engaging in excessive activities like racing and hunting or obsessing over hard-to-obtain goods. These pursuits can drive the heart mad and impede one's progress in life.

The wise person, according to the text, acts for the belly - the inner essence - rather than being led by the eyes, which are easily captivated by external appearances. This implies focusing on cultivating inner balance, wisdom, and contentment, rather than seeking fulfillment through sensory pleasures and material possessions.

By letting go of distractions and superficial pursuits, one can choose a path that aligns with the Tao, fostering inner peace, harmony, and spiritual growth.

Chapter 13:
Original Chinese text:

寵辱若驚，貴大患若身。何謂寵辱若驚？寵為下，得之若驚，失之若驚，是謂寵辱若驚。何謂貴大患若身？吾所以有大患者，為吾有身，及吾無身，吾有何患？故貴以身為天下，若可寄天下；愛以身為天下，若可託天下。

My translation:

Favour and disgrace bring alarm;
To value great misfortune as one's own body.
What does it mean, "Favour and disgrace bring alarm"?
Favour is degrading; receiving it brings alarm, losing it brings alarm.
This is why favour and disgrace bring alarm.
What does it mean, "To value great misfortune as one's own body"?
The reason I have great misfortune is that I have a body.
If I have no body, what misfortune can I have?
Therefore, if you cherish your body for the sake of the world,
You can entrust the world to your care.
If you love your body for the sake of the world,
You can be entrusted with the world.

Commentary:

Chapter 13 of the Tao Te Ching discusses the concepts of favour, disgrace, and misfortune, as well as their relationship to the self and one's body.

The text states that both favour and disgrace can cause alarm because they can be gained or lost unexpectedly. Favour, in particular, is considered degrading because it places one in a vulnerable position, subject to the whims of others. This instability is the reason favour and disgrace bring alarm.

The chapter also explores the idea of valuing misfortune as one's own body. The notion is that misfortune arises because of our attachment to our physical selves. If we were to let go of this attachment, we would be free from the fear of misfortune.

By cherishing and loving one's body for the sake of the world, one can act as a guardian and caretaker of the world. This selfless approach allows one to be entrusted with the responsibility of caring for the world and its people.

In essence, this chapter teaches the importance of letting go of attachments to external circumstances and our physical selves. By doing so, we can cultivate inner peace and stability, and act as wise and compassionate guardians for the world around us.

Chapter 14:
Original Chinese text:

視之不見，名曰夷；聽之不聞，名曰希；搏之不得，名曰微。此三者不可致詰，故混而為一。其上不皦，其下不昧。繩繩不可名，復歸於無物。是謂無狀之狀，無物之象，是謂惚恍。迎之不見其首，隨之不見其後。執古之道，以御今之有。能知古始，是謂道紀。

My translation:

Look at it, and you cannot see it; it is called elusive.
Listen to it, and you cannot hear it; it is called rarefied.
Grasp at it, and you cannot hold it; it is called subtle.
These three cannot be further examined, and so they merge into one.
Its upper part is not bright, and its lower part is not dark.
Endless and unnameable, it returns to the realm of nothingness.
This is the form of the formless, the image of the imageless, called indefinable and beyond imagination.
Approach it and there is no beginning; follow it and there is no end.
Hold onto the ancient Tao to manage present existence.
To know the ancient origin, this is called the essence of the Tao.

Commentary:

Chapter 14 of the Tao Te Ching discusses the elusive, rarefied, and subtle nature of the Tao, as well as the importance of embracing the ancient Tao to understand and manage the present.

The text describes the Tao as being beyond the reach of our senses and understanding. It is elusive, rarefied, and subtle, making it impossible to fully grasp or examine. These three aspects ultimately merge into one, symbolizing the unity and mystery of the Tao.

The chapter goes on to explain that the Tao is formless, imageless, and indefinable, existing beyond the realm of human comprehension. It is endless, with no beginning or end, and can only be understood through embracing its essence.

By holding onto the ancient Tao, one can manage present existence and gain insight into the ancient origins of the universe. This understanding is considered the essence of the Tao, which allows individuals to navigate their lives with wisdom and balance.

In this chapter, the reader is encouraged to contemplate the mysterious nature of the Tao and to cultivate a connection with the ancient wisdom it embodies, fostering harmony and balance in their lives.

Chapter 15:
Original Chinese text:

古之善為士者，微妙玄通，深不可識。夫唯不可識，故強為之容。豫兮若冬涉川；猶兮若畏四鄰；儼兮其若容；渙兮若冰之將釋；敦兮其若樸；曠兮其若谷；混兮其若濁；孰能濁以靜之徐清？孰能安以久動之徐生？保此道者，不欲盈。夫唯不盈，故能蔽不新成。

My translation:

The ancient masters of virtue were subtle, mysterious, profound, and deeply discerning.
Their wisdom was unfathomable, and thus it is difficult to describe them.
Cautious, like crossing a stream in winter;
Hesitant, as if fearing their neighbours on all sides;
Reserved, like a guest;
Yielding, like ice about to melt;
Simple, like uncarved wood;
Open, like a valley;
And opaque, like muddy water.
Who can be muddled and use stillness to gradually become clear?
Who can be at rest and use movement to gradually come to life?
Those who maintain this Tao do not desire to be full.
Precisely because they are not full, they can be renewed and not be depleted.

Commentary:

Chapter 15 of the Tao Te Ching focuses on the qualities of the ancient masters of virtue and their approach to cultivating and maintaining the Tao.

The ancient masters were subtle, mysterious, profound, and deeply discerning. Their wisdom was beyond ordinary comprehension, making it difficult to describe or imitate. The text then lists several qualities that characterized these masters, such as caution, hesitance, reserve, yielding, simplicity, openness, and an ability to remain opaque.

The chapter also poses two rhetorical questions: who can be muddled and use stillness to gradually become clear, and who can be at rest and use movement to gradually come to life? These questions encourage the reader to reflect on the wisdom of the ancient masters and to strive for the same depth of understanding.

Those who maintain the Tao, according to the text, do not desire to be full. It is precisely this lack of desire for fullness that allows them to be renewed and not depleted. By embracing the qualities of the ancient masters and cultivating the Tao, one can achieve a state of balance, harmony, and enduring wisdom.

Chapter 16:
Original Chinese text:

致虛極，守靜篤，萬物並作，吾以觀復。夫物芸芸，各復歸其根。歸根曰靜，是謂復命。復命曰常，知常曰明。不知常，妄作凶。知常容，容乃公，公乃王，王乃天，天乃道，道乃久，沒身不殆。

My translation:

Embrace the ultimate emptiness,
Cultivate deep tranquility.
While all things rise and flourish,
I watch their return to their roots.
Everything flourishes, then each returns to its origin.
Returning to the origin is called tranquility;
Tranquility is called returning to life;
Returning to life is the constant;
Knowing the constant is wisdom.
Not knowing the constant leads to reckless actions and misfortune.
Knowing the constant brings tolerance;
Tolerance brings impartiality;
Impartiality brings sovereignty;
Sovereignty brings the heavenly;
The heavenly brings the Tao;
The Tao brings eternity;
Though the body dies, one remains undamaged.

Commentary:

Chapter 16 of the Tao Te Ching emphasizes the importance of embracing emptiness, cultivating tranquility, and understanding the constant nature of the universe.

The text encourages the reader to embrace ultimate emptiness and cultivate deep tranquility, in order to observe the rise and fall of all things. Everything in the world flourishes and then returns to its origin. Returning to the origin is associated with tranquility, which is the source of life and the constant nature of the universe.

Knowing the constant is considered wisdom, while not knowing it leads to reckless actions and misfortune. By understanding the constant, one can cultivate tolerance, impartiality, sovereignty, and a connection with the heavenly and the Tao. This knowledge leads to a deeper understanding of the eternal nature of existence.

Though the body may die, one who embraces the teachings of the Tao remains undamaged, as their essence is connected to the eternal nature of the universe. This chapter encourages readers to cultivate emptiness and tranquility, while also seeking wisdom and understanding of the constant in order to achieve harmony and balance in their lives.

Chapter 17:
Original Chinese text:

太上，下知有之；其次，親而譽之；其次，畏之；其次，侮之。信不足焉，有不信焉。悠兮，其貴言。功成事遂，百姓皆謂我自然。

My translation:

In the highest antiquity, people barely knew their rulers existed;
Next came those who were loved and praised;
Then came those who were feared;
And finally, those who were despised.
When trust is insufficient, there will be no trust in return.
Reluctantly, these rulers valued their words.
When their work was accomplished and their tasks completed,
The people would say, "We did it naturally."

Commentary:

Chapter 17 of the Tao Te Ching discusses different types of rulers and the importance of trust, as well as the value of ruling in a way that allows the people to feel they have accomplished things naturally.

In the highest antiquity, rulers were so effective that the people barely knew they existed. These rulers governed with such wisdom and subtlety that their subjects felt as if they were guiding themselves. The next level of rulers were those who were loved and praised by their people, followed by rulers who were feared, and finally those who were despised.

The text emphasizes that when trust is insufficient, it is hard for people to trust their ruler in return. As a result, reluctant rulers placed a high value on their words, aiming to gain the trust and respect of their people.

The chapter concludes by describing the ideal scenario where the ruler's work is accomplished and tasks are completed, with the people feeling as though they have achieved everything naturally. This highlights the importance of governing with a light touch, allowing people to feel empowered and responsible for their own success.

Chapter 18:
Original Chinese text:

大道廢，有仁義；智慧出，有大偽；六親不和，有孝慈；國家昏亂，有忠臣。

My translation:

When the great Tao is abandoned,
Benevolence and righteousness arise.
When wisdom and intelligence emerge,
Great pretense follows.
When harmony among family members is lost,
Filial piety and parental love are emphasized.
When the nation falls into chaos,
Loyal ministers appear.

Commentary:

Chapter 18 of the Tao Te Ching describes the consequences of abandoning the great Tao and the emergence of alternative virtues and values as a result.

The text explains that when the great Tao is abandoned, benevolence and righteousness arise. This suggests that these virtues are not inherently negative, but rather they emerge as a response to the loss of the Tao, and can sometimes be an inferior substitute for the natural harmony the Tao provides.

Similarly, when wisdom and intelligence emerge, great pretense follows. This implies that an overemphasis on knowledge and cleverness can lead to a loss of authenticity and sincerity.

The chapter also mentions the loss of harmony among family members, which results in an emphasis on filial piety and parental love. This signifies that when the natural order and unity are disrupted, society tends to focus on specific virtues and values to compensate for the lost harmony.

Finally, when the nation falls into chaos, loyal ministers appear. This serves as a reminder that in times of strife and disorder, loyalty and dedication become crucial in restoring stability and order.

In essence, Chapter 18 highlights the importance of maintaining a connection to the great Tao, as abandoning it can lead to the emergence of secondary virtues and values that are not as effective in promoting harmony and balance within society.

Chapter 19:
Original Chinese text:

絕聖棄智，民利百倍；絕仁棄義，民復孝慈；絕巧棄利，盜賊無有。此三者，以為文不足。故令有所屬：見素抱朴，少私寡欲。

My translation:

Abandon holiness and discard cleverness,
And the people will benefit a hundredfold.
Abandon benevolence and discard righteousness,
And the people will return to filial piety and parental love.
Abandon cunning and discard profit,
And theft and robbery will disappear.
These three teachings are not enough;
Therefore, let there be something to which they can adhere:
Embrace simplicity and hold on to the uncarved wood,
Reduce selfishness and restrain desires.

Commentary:

Chapter 19 of the Tao Te Ching suggests that abandoning certain values and virtues can lead to a more harmonious and balanced society, and encourages people to embrace simplicity and restrain desires.

The text proposes that by abandoning holiness and discarding cleverness, the people will benefit a hundredfold. This implies that an overemphasis on these qualities can lead to a loss of authenticity and harmony. Similarly, abandoning benevolence and discarding righteousness would lead to a return to the natural virtues of filial piety and parental love. The chapter also suggests that by abandoning cunning and discarding profit, theft and robbery will disappear.

However, the text also acknowledges that these three teachings are not enough on their own, so there must be something to which they can adhere. The chapter encourages people to embrace simplicity and hold on to the uncarved wood, symbolizing the natural state of things, untainted by human intervention. Additionally, the text advises reducing selfishness and restraining desires, which can help promote harmony and balance in society.

In summary, Chapter 19 emphasizes the importance of embracing simplicity and restraining desires, while suggesting that abandoning certain virtues and values can lead to a more harmonious and balanced society.

Chapter 20:
Original Chinese text:

絕學無憂。唯之與阿，相去幾何？美之與惡，相去若何？人之所畏，不可不畏。荒兮，其未央哉！衆人熙熙，如享太牢，如春登臺。我獨泊兮，其未兆；如嬰兒之未孩。儽儽兮，若無所歸。衆人皆有餘，而我獨若遺。我愚人之心也哉！沌沌兮。俗人昭昭，我獨昏昏。俗人察察，我獨悶悶。澹兮，其若海；飉兮，若無止。衆人皆有以，而我獨頑且鄙。我獨異於人，而貴食母。

My translation:

Abandon learning and be free from worries.
How much difference is there between "yes" and "no"?
How much difference is there between good and evil?
About what others fear, one cannot be fearless.
Endless, indeed, it seems without a beginning!
The multitude of people are bustling,
As if enjoying a great feast,
As if ascending a tower in spring.
I alone remain quiet and unconcerned,
Like an infant who has not yet smiled,
Listless, as if I have no home to return to.
The multitude of people all have more than enough,
While I alone seem to have lost everything.
I have the heart of a fool, indeed, so confused!
Ordinary people are bright,
I alone am dull.
Ordinary people are sharp,
I alone am muddled.
Calm, like the ocean,
Drifting, as if without stopping.
The multitude of people all have a purpose,
While I alone am stubborn and uncouth.
I alone am different from others,
And value being nourished by the Mother.

Commentary:

Chapter 20 of the Tao Te Ching reflects on the differences between the sage and ordinary people, and the value of being nourished by the Tao, referred to as the "Mother."

The text begins by suggesting that abandoning learning can lead to a life free from worries. It also questions the distinctions between "yes" and "no," and between good and evil, encouraging readers to contemplate the nature of these dichotomies.

The chapter goes on to describe the sage as quiet, unconcerned, and drifting, unlike the bustling multitude of people. The sage seems to have lost everything, but in reality, they are nourished by the Tao. The sage appears foolish, dull, and muddled compared to ordinary people, yet their calmness and seeming aimlessness are in fact expressions of their deep connection to the Tao.

In this chapter, the reader is encouraged to embrace the qualities of the sage, such as calmness, listlessness, and detachment from worldly concerns, in order to find nourishment and guidance from the Tao.

Chapter 21:
Original Chinese text:

孔德之容，唯道是從。道之為物，唯恍唯惚。忽兮恍兮，其中有象；恍兮忽兮，其中有物。窈兮冥兮，其中有精；其精甚真，其中有信。自古及今，其名不去，以閱衆甫。吾何以知衆甫之狀哉？以此。

My translation:

The manifestation of great virtue follows only the Tao.
The Tao itself is elusive, vague.
Vague and elusive, yet within it there is form;
Elusive and vague, yet within it there is substance.
Deep and obscure, yet within it there is essence;
This essence is supremely real,
And within it lies great trust.
From ancient times to now,
Its name has never been forgotten,
And it serves to observe the myriad things.
How do I know the nature of the myriad things?
By this.

Commentary:

Chapter 21 of the Tao Te Ching focuses on the relationship between great virtue and the Tao, emphasizing that the Tao, despite its elusive and vague nature, contains the essence of all things and can be observed in the myriad things of the world.

The text suggests that the manifestation of great virtue follows only the Tao, pointing out the importance of aligning oneself with the Tao in order to embody the highest form of virtue. The Tao is described as elusive, vague, deep, and obscure, but it contains form, substance, and essence. This essence is supremely real, and within it lies great trust.

The chapter also states that the name of the Tao has never been forgotten throughout history, and it serves as a means to observe and understand the myriad things in the world. The author, Laozi, claims to know the nature of these myriad things through the Tao itself.

In summary, Chapter 21 highlights the importance of following the Tao in order to manifest great virtue, and emphasizes that the elusive and vague nature of the Tao contains the essence of all things, which can be observed and understood by those who align themselves with it.

Chapter 22:
Original Chinese text:

曲則全，枉則直，窪則盈，敝則新，少則得，多則惑。是以聖人抱一為天下式。不自見，故明；不自是，故彰；不自伐，故有功；不自矜，故長。夫唯不爭，故天下莫能與之爭。古之所謂曲則全者，豈虛言哉！誠全而歸之。

My translation:

To yield is to be whole,
To bend is to be straight,
To be empty is to be full,
To be worn out is to be renewed,
To have little is to gain,
To have much is to be confused.
Therefore, the sage embraces the One and becomes a model for the world.
They do not show themselves, and so they are enlightened;
They do not assert themselves, and so they are distinguished;
They do not boast, and so they have merit;
They do not take pride, and so they endure.
Because they do not contend, no one in the world can contend against them.
The ancient saying, "To yield is to be whole," is it not true?
Truly, they become whole and return to the One.

Commentary:

Chapter 22 of the Tao Te Ching teaches the importance of yielding, embracing the One, and embodying humility in order to achieve wholeness and harmony with the Tao.

The text emphasizes that yielding leads to wholeness, bending results in straightness, emptiness allows for fullness, and being worn out brings renewal. It suggests that having little can lead to gain, while having much may cause confusion.

The sage embraces the One and becomes a model for the world. They demonstrate humility and do not seek to show themselves, assert their own importance, boast about their achievements, or take pride in their abilities. This humility allows them to be enlightened, distinguished, meritorious, and enduring.

The chapter reiterates the ancient saying that yielding leads to wholeness and suggests that by yielding, one can return to the One – the Tao itself. In essence, Chapter 22 teaches the value of humility, yielding, and embracing the One in order to achieve harmony with the Tao and become a model for the world.

Chapter 23:
Original Chinese text:

希言自然，故飄風不終朝，驟雨不終日。孰為此者？天地。天地尚不能久，而況於人乎？故從事於道者，道者，同於道；德者，同於德；失者，同於失。同於道者，道亦樂得之；同於德者，德亦樂得之；同於失者，失亦樂得之。信不足，焉有不信焉。

My translation:

Sparse words are natural,
Thus a gusty wind does not last the whole morning,
And a sudden rain does not last the whole day.
Who creates these phenomena? Heaven and Earth.
Even Heaven and Earth cannot make them last long,
How much less can humans?
Therefore, when one follows the Tao:
Those who are at one with the Tao, the Tao gladly welcomes;
Those who are at one with virtue, virtue gladly welcomes;
Those who are at one with loss, loss gladly welcomes.
If one lacks faith, how can they have faith?

Commentary:

Chapter 23 of the Tao Te Ching emphasizes the naturalness of sparse words and the importance of being at one with the Tao, virtue, and loss.

The text begins by stating that sparse words are natural, as demonstrated by the transient nature of gusty winds and sudden rains, which do not last long. These phenomena are created by Heaven and Earth, and even they cannot make them last for an extended period. This suggests that humans, too, should not expect permanence.

When one follows the Tao, they can become at one with the Tao, virtue, or loss. When one is at one with these aspects, they are gladly welcomed by the Tao, virtue, or loss, respectively. The chapter also notes the importance of faith, suggesting that if one lacks faith, it is unlikely that they will experience faith.

In essence, Chapter 23 teaches the naturalness of sparse words and the transient nature of phenomena, emphasizing the importance of aligning oneself with the Tao, virtue, and loss in order to achieve harmony and balance.

Chapter 24:
Original Chinese text:

企者不立；跨者不行；自見者不明；自是者不彰；自伐者無功；自矜者不長。其在道也，曰：餘食贅行。物或惡之，故有道者不處。

My translation:

Those who stand on tiptoes do not stand firm;
Those who take long strides cannot walk fast;
Those who show off themselves do not shine;
Those who assert themselves are not distinguished;
Those who boast about themselves have no merit;
Those who take pride in themselves do not endure.
In the Tao, these actions are called:
Excess food and unnecessary baggage.
Things may despise them,
Therefore, those who follow the Tao do not dwell in them.

Commentary:

Chapter 24 of the Tao Te Ching focuses on the pitfalls of self-aggrandizement and the importance of humility in aligning oneself with the Tao.

The text offers several metaphors to illustrate the consequences of self-promotion and lack of humility: those who stand on tiptoes are unstable, those who take long strides cannot walk fast, and so on. These actions lead to a lack of stability, effectiveness, and endurance. In essence, the text teaches that self-aggrandizement and self-centeredness are counterproductive.

The chapter refers to these actions as excess food and unnecessary baggage, suggesting that they are burdensome and undesirable. Since these actions are despised by the natural order of things, those who follow the Tao do not engage in them.

In summary, Chapter 24 emphasizes the importance of humility and avoiding self-aggrandizement in order to align oneself with the Tao and achieve harmony and balance in life.
