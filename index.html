        <p>Our inner world might be imagined as a vast, intricate labyrinth. Some pathways are well-lit and familiar, places we know well. Other passages might remain less travelled - perhaps holding experiences or emotions that felt too overwhelming to approach before.</p>
          <br>
        <p>Within this labyrinth, we might find guardians at certain passages - parts of ourselves that have helped us survive, protecting us when we needed protection. These guardians carry their own wisdom, their own stories, their own deep knowing of what we've needed along the way.</p>

      <p>The therapeutic space offers a gentle holding as you explore your inner labyrinth. Here, each turn in the path is met with patience, each guardian encountered with respect. There's room for all that might arise - uncertainty, curiosity, hesitation, hope.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Sometimes, it's in the quiet moments between words that something meaningful emerges. A pause in the journey, a moment of noticing, a subtle shift in how something feels. Each of these moments has its place here. Here, you're invited to explore, to question, to simply be.</p>

    <div class="expandable-content">
      <p>As we sit with our experience, the labyrinth speaks to us in many ways. Sometimes through the body - a tightness in the chest, a flutter in the stomach, a moment of ease. Sometimes through images or memories that arise unexpectedly, like finding an unfamiliar passage.</p>
    <br>  
      <p>Our therapeutic relationship itself becomes a gentle mirror, reflecting patterns from your life and offering insights into how you connect with others and yourself. Past experiences might echo in present moments, coloring your perceptions in ways that, once noticed, can bring new understanding.</p>
     <br> 
      <p>Each of these expressions carries its own meaning, its own truth. In therapy, we can create space to hear these different voices, allowing them to be present in their own time, in their own way.</p>

      <p>Each person's journey through their inner labyrinth is uniquely their own. Some might notice subtle shifts over time - perhaps a familiar passage feeling different, or a previously overwhelming path becoming possible to approach. Others might discover new questions arising, or find different meanings in long-known places.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Whatever emerges, therapy offers a space where each step, each pause, each return can be held with gentleness. There's no need to rush, no particular path to take. Sometimes, simply being accompanied as we stand where we are can open new possibilities.</p>

      <br>
      <p>This experience informs how I am present with others - with patience, with respect for each person's unique path, and with trust in the profound value of being truly heard and understood.</p>
