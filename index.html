    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
    Now, if you are still reading, I invite you to take a deep breath. As you do, you might notice the gentle rise and fall of your chest. Perhaps you'd like to settle into your surroundings,
    feeling the weight of your body grounding you to this present moment. As you continue to breathe, you may become aware of its rhythm, a constant companion on your
    life's journey. As you read these words, allow yourself, if you wish, to sink into a space of curiosity and potential. 
    <br><br>
    <img src="profile.webp" alt="photo of David" class="avatar" title="Here is a photo of me, in case you were wondering"> Hello there. I'm David O'Donohue,
    a clinical psychologist offering guidance for those ready to explore the intricate landscapes of their inner world. 
    <br><br></p>
    <h2>A Space for Authentic Expression</h2>
    <p>As you step into the therapy space, you might notice a sense of calm settling over you. Picture yourself sinking into a comfortable chair, feeling its support beneath
      you. The room around you is designed to be a container for whatever you might bring to our session.
      <br><br>
    As time unfolds, you may become aware of a gentle rhythm emerging in the space. Your words might flow more freely than you expected, finding their way into the
    open air. You might feel a subtle shift as you realise your experiences are being received and held with care - perhaps in a way you've rarely encountered before.
    <br><br>
    In this environment, you may find yourself noticing the ebb and flow of your emotions more clearly. A slight change in your tone, a subtle shift in your posture - these
    unspoken expressions are part of your story, too. You may be surprised at the depth of understanding that can arise from paying attention to these moments.
    <br><br>
    This is a place where your experiences, in all their complexity, are welcomed. Here, you're invited to explore, to question, to simply be. It's a space where your
    unique journey is the focus, where curiosity about your experiences is the guiding principle. In this protected environment, we may embark on a journey of self-discovery,
    moving at a pace that feels right for you. There's no rush, no pressure, no judgment. Only a gentle invitation to explore, understand, and heal.
    <br><br></p>
    <h2>Navigating the Labyrinth: Our Inner World and Its Hidden Passages</h2>
<p>
Imagine your inner world as a vast, intricate labyrinth. Some pathways are well-lit and frequently traveled, representing the parts of ourselves we readily accept.
<br><br>
But there are other passages - shadowy and unexplored - that often contain the experiences and emotions we've tried to avoid or protect ourselves from, usually
because they felt too overwhelming or shameful to face.
<br><br>
These hidden passages often house our deepest vulnerabilities, stemming from attachment wounds and past traumas. In our attempts to avoid these areas, we build internal
barriers and station guardians at certain junctions, requiring constant energy to maintain. These guardians, born from our deep-seated fears, work tirelessly to
divert us from these vulnerable parts of our psyche.
<br><br>
Paradoxically, it's often these barriers, guardians, and the effort of maintaining them that create or intensify the very concerns bringing you to therapy. While
their intention is to protect, they can hold us back from the connection and authenticity we crave. We may consciously desire genuine relationships and self-acceptance,
yet these protective mechanisms can lead us to unknowingly avoid the very intimacy we seek, often resulting in patterns of self-sabotage. Moreover, the avoided content within
these hidden passages doesn't simply disappear; it can emerge in unconscious ways, influencing our behaviors, relationships, and well-being in ways we may not readily understand.
<br><br>
Our work together is like a gentle exploration of this labyrinth of your psyche. With compassion as our lantern, we'll slowly approach those unexplored passages. As we
carefully navigate them, we begin a process of reclaiming and integrating the lost parts of yourself, moving towards a more authentic and whole sense of self.
<br><br>
In our exploration, we'll draw upon an integrated psychodynamic and somatic approach. This perspective recognises that the body and the unconscious are intrinsically
linked - the body provides access to the unconscious, while unconscious material resides within the body. Our work together emphasises bringing avoided, painful, but
authentic and important content to the conscious mind through curious and compassionate exploration. 
<br><br>
In our therapeutic journey, we approach these hidden passages and their guardians with gentleness and understanding. We acknowledge their important protective role while
exploring how we might redirect their energy. As you allow yourself to be more authentic, less energy may be needed for avoidance and control, freeing up resources for
growth and self-discovery.
<br><br>
As we carefully navigate these unexplored areas of your inner labyrinth, we create space for a more authentic and whole sense of self to emerge. This journey towards
vulnerability and genuine intimacy is taken step by step. Through this exploration, many find they're better equipped to navigate uncertainty, improve relationships,
and gain a richer understanding of themselves.
<br><br></p>
<h2>Listening to the Whispers in the Labyrinth</h2>
<p>
As we navigate the labyrinth of your inner world, we pay attention to the myriad ways your experiences manifest. This isn't just about conscious thoughts or physical
sensations, but about noticing the subtle currents that flow through the passages of your being.
<br><br>
You might become aware of:<br>
    1. The wisdom your body holds: A tightness in your chest, a flutter in your stomach - these physical sensations are messengers, perhaps pointing to unexplored
    passages we've yet to discover.<br> 
    2. The wanderings of your mind: Where your thoughts drift when given space can reveal hidden pathways to unexplored areas of your psyche.<br> 
    3. The dynamics of our therapeutic relationship: How you feel in our interactions can mirror patterns from your life, offering valuable insights into your
    ways of relating to others and yourself.<br> 
    4. Spontaneous ideas and images: Thoughts or visualisations that seem to arise from nowhere often carry profound meaning, like clues to navigating sections
    of the labyrinth you didn't know existed.<br> 
    5. Emotional echoes: How past experiences resonate with present moments, coloring your perceptions and reactions in ways you might not have noticed before.
    <br><br> 
By learning to listen to these various aspects of your experience, you can develop a more complete understanding of yourself. This holistic approach can lead to profound
insights and lasting change. As we progress, you might find:<br>
- Previously blocked passages opening up, allowing for a more integrated and authentic sense of self<br>
- The quiet whispers of your body growing clearer, offering valuable guidance through the labyrinth<br>
- Previously overwhelming emotions becoming more manageable and even friendly, as they finally feel acknowledged and understood<br>
- The protective barriers you've built within the labyrinth gradually softening, allowing for more authentic and vulnerable connections with others and yourself<br> 
- A newfound capacity to sit with uncertainty and intense emotions, finding peace in the twists and turns of your inner journey<br>
This process of noticing and exploring is gentle yet powerful. It's about creating a space where all parts of you - known and unknown, comfortable and
challenging - can be acknowledged and integrated. As we journey together, you may discover new depths to your experiences, uncovering strengths and resources
you didn't know you had.
<br><br>
As you become more attuned to these subtle signals, you may develop a richer, more nuanced relationship with your inner labyrinth. This growing self-awareness can lead
to a sense of empowerment, as you learn to navigate your internal landscape with greater ease and understanding.
<br><br></p>
<h2>A Personal Journey</h2>
<p>
I, too, have walked through the winding paths of my own inner labyrinth, encountering unexpected turns and protective guardians along the way. It's been a long journey,
and one that I'm still navigating. Through reflection, mindfulness, self-compassion, and my own therapy, I continue to explore and understand the intricate passages of my psyche.
<br><br>
This ongoing personal journey informs my work as a therapist. It deepens my empathy, fuels my commitment to growth, and reminds me of the courage it takes to venture into
the unexplored areas of our inner world. I bring this lived experience to our sessions, not as someone who has mapped out the entire labyrinth, but as a fellow traveller
who understands the challenges and rewards of the terrain.
<br><br></p>
<h2>Our Therapeutic Partnership</h2>
<p>
In our work together, my role is not to provide a map with predefined routes, but to walk beside you with open-minded curiosity as we explore the labyrinth of your inner
world. We'll examine the unique twists and turns of your experiences and perspectives, never judging, always seeking to understand and connect more deeply.
<br><br>
This journey is about rediscovering your authentic self, welcoming all aspects of your experience, and responding with self-compassion. It's an invitation to
wholeness - a chance to reclaim the parts of yourself you've hidden in distant corners of the labyrinth and to cultivate a deep, abiding connection with your true nature.
Through this process, many find they're better equipped to navigate the uncertainty of life's maze, improve relationships, and gain a richer understanding of themselves.
<br><br></p>
<h2>Taking the First Step</h2>
<p>
Take another deep breath. Feel the quiet stirring of possibility within you, like a gentle breeze at the entrance of your inner labyrinth.
<br><br>
The journey of self-discovery and healing is a profound one, and deciding to embark on it is a courageous act. Seeking a guide for this exploration is a testament
to your strength and desire for a more fulfilling life.
<br><br>
Welcome to the possibility of coming home to yourself, of reclaiming all parts of your experience with compassion and understanding, and of living with greater authenticity
and integration. As we step into the labyrinth together, know that each turn, each discovery, brings you closer to a more whole and authentic version of yourself.

      <br><br></p>
      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I have always been interested in how our minds work. They are a complex system of thoughts, feelings, and impulses,
        from which such a diverse range of patterns of perception and behaviour emerge.
        I also find interpersonal connection, emotional attunement, and equanimity to emotions to be highly rewarding.
        <br><br>
        I am very interested in some of the paradoxes of mental health: the more we try to eliminate uncertainty, the more uncertain
        we feel; the more we crave authentic connections, the less authentic our connections seem; the more we strive for
        perfection, the more flawed we feel; the more we try to control our cravings, the more overpowering they become;
        the more we try to suppress our distress, the more intense and pervasive it becomes; the more we seek happiness in
        external achievements, the less fulfilled we feel; the harder we fight our emotions, the stronger they seem to grip
        us; and the more we try to protect ourselves from or avoid a particular situation, the more often we find ourselves
        facing that very situation.
        <br><br>
        This psychological interest is complemented by an interest in taoism, particularly the ancient observation that
        many things which appear to be opposites are actually interdependent, and exist in a dynamic equilibrium. Pushing
        something in a particular direction can sometimes result in the opposite occurring. This observation is, in fact,
        part of the basis of my practice name.
        <br><br></p>
        <h2>About My Approach</h2>
        <p>
        I take a client-centered, non-directive approach to therapy. This means that I don't bring an agenda to sessions,
        and am instead guided by what each client is looking for. I aim to fully understand each client,
        from their perspective, with all of the complex and often contradictory thoughts and feelings that come from
        living in an uncertain world. In doing so, I hope to provide a safe space for exploration, self-insight, and internal
        harmony.
        <br><br>
        Drawing from a range of emotion-focused and insight-based therapeutic approaches, I view psychological progress as
        a journey towards feeling safe enough to think flexibly about our past, present, and future. However, I don't see it
        as my place to "correct" anything the mind is doing, and instead try to collaboratively understand what it is doing, and why.
        Often, when we understand the different parts of our mind, we can either more clearly see a resolution that comes from within,
        or are more willing to accept the help our mind is trying to give us.
        <br><br>
        I genuinely believe that every thought, feeling, or
        impulse a person has, even conflicting ones, makes sense in a certain context. This means that instead of judging or
        pathologising a person's experience, I can be open to understanding it. 
      </p> -->
      <!-- <h2>About My Approach</h2>
      <p>
                Many individuals seeking psychological support often find themselves contending with unwanted thoughts, feelings, or behaviours, frequently referred to as 'symptoms'. These symptoms often surface as adaptive responses to earlier challenges, particularly when other options may have been scarce.
                <br><br>
                One of the remarkable faculties of our minds is the ability to encode these solutions into our implicit memory, automating them into what we might call our 'autopilot'. While this can be advantageous, facilitating numerous tasks without requiring much conscious effort, these once adaptive patterns may feel more like obstacles than solutions over time, or as our circumstances evolve.
                <br><br>
                Rather than categorising these patterns as 'bad' and striving to suppress them, my therapeutic approach focuses on recognising the value they either once had or may still have in your life. I allow space for understanding and curiosity to develop, so that we can explore both the origins and the profound emotional significance of these patterns in your life. Take the example of a relentless inner critic. While it may be presently overwhelming, it could have originally served as a protective mechanism to anticipate and manage others' reactions.
                <br><br>
                Every decision we make carries advantages and drawbacks, which may not be entirely visible when initially taken, given our varying emotional states and changing life circumstances. For example, at some point, you may have chosen to dodge discomfort, only to find that this choice eventually led to feelings of loneliness or emptiness.
                <br><br>
                Such choices might have been made by a part of your mind in the past, preserved in implicit memory, and subsequently forgotten, resulting in the conscious mind feeling at odds with the unconscious/implicit mind. This dynamic might resemble two teams within a company working against each other.
                <br><br>
                While we can attempt to understand these components of our mind intellectually, genuine resolution of internal conflict often arises when we engage with these parts on an emotional level. This involves progressing beyond a purely logical grasp of a perspective and cultivating a deep, embodied understanding. This depth of comprehension can nurture a more compassionate and nuanced relationship with these aspects of ourselves, fostering more fruitful internal collaboration. The end product of this process often entails either developing a greater tolerance for the inner mechanics of the mind, or a re-assessment and adjustment of past decisions on an emotional level.
                <br><br>
                Through therapy, the goal is to surface these unconscious decisions into conscious awareness, shedding light on the choices various aspects of yourself made in the past. Recognising these choices does not mean rejecting these parts, but instead acknowledging them, appreciating their significance, and reconsidering their ongoing role in your life. This fosters an environment of openness, understanding, and harmony between the conscious and unconscious mind.
                <br><br>
                Enhanced self-awareness opens the door for exploring alternative choices that harmonise better with your current needs and circumstances, or for fostering a deeper acceptance of a choice that continues to be beneficial. As your therapist, my role is to guide you on this journey towards acknowledging and integrating all aspects of your mind, with the ultimate aim of improving your mental health and overall well-being.
              </p> -->
                <!-- 
                I think that a helpful way to think about mental health is in terms of internal conflict. People seeking psychological support are often in the position of experiencing unwanted thoughts, feelings, or compulsions/behaviors. We can refer to these as "symptoms." These symptoms typically develop as a solution to an early problem, when better alternatives are unavailable or inaccessible. Over time, these thought patterns become automatic, and when our circumstances change, we may start to view them as detrimental.
<br><br>
In response, we might attempt to repress these patterns and label the entire thought pattern as "bad." For example, someone with a harsh inner critic might decide that all self-criticism is harmful and try to suppress it. However, this repression has two significant consequences.
<br><br>
Firstly, it appears that subconscious thought patterns are challenging to change if they remain hidden. To alter them, we need to get in touch with the version of ourselves which created the solution in the first place. Secondly, (if we assume that evolution has shaped all mental activities to be useful in some context) repressing a thought pattern may deprive us of its benefits. As a result, an unmet need for this pattern may build up, leading to a swing back towards it, often manifesting in an unwanted form.
<br><br>
My approach to therapy revolves around understanding these symptoms, their origins, and the value of the underlying thought pattern. By exploring the functions they serve and finding ways to balance these needs with other ways of being, clients can achieve a more harmonious state, either a middle ground which incorporates two different ways of being, or an acceptance of the different ways of being.
<br><br>
In essence, my approach to therapy is about guiding clients towards greater self-awareness and an understanding of their symptoms, helping them appreciate the value of their thought patterns, and discovering how to find balance in their lives. By doing so, clients can learn to embrace and integrate all aspects of their minds, ultimately leading to improved mental health and well-being.</p> -->

// "It's a huge psychological achievement to accept other humans in their bewildering mixture of good and bad… no one we love will ever satisfy us completely—but that this is never a reason to hate them either.

"You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop. - Rumi",
"Your hurt is welcome here. It can put down its bags and stay awhile. It won't be jostled. It won't be rushed. It won't be asked to hurt less, or to hurt differently, or to distract itself.
