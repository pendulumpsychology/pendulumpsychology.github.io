      Welcome! 
      I'm David O'Donohue, a registered psychologist and clinical psychology registrar. I am currently accepting new
      clients (note that I do not provide assessment services, and am not accepting
      new clients under the age of 18). New and existing clients can make appointments
      through <a href="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/booking.html">the booking page</a>.
      If you have any questions or need assistance booking an appointment, please feel free to reach out to me directly at
      <a href="mailto:pendulumpsychology@gmail.com">pendulumpsychology@gmail.com</a>.
      <br><br>
      I have always been fascinated by the complexities of the human mind and how it shapes our emotions and behaviors.
      I have been drawn to the helping professions from an early age, driven by a combination of intellectual curiosity
      and a desire to connect with people on a deep, emotional level.
      <br><br>
      I view my role as a facilitator of self-awareness, creating a space where my clients feel truly heard, seen,
      and accepted. In our sessions, there is no agenda, only an openness to understanding your unique experience and
      supporting you in your journey toward greater understanding and self-harmony. This perspective is also complemented
      by principles drawn from Taoist wisdom, emphasising the harmony and interdependence of opposites. My ultimate aim is to
      deepen my understanding of the human mind and share this knowledge in
      ways that can benefit my clients, my family, and anyone open to exploring the intricacies of our shared human experience.
      <br><br></p>
      <h2>About My Approach</h2>
      <p>
                Many individuals seeking psychological support often find themselves contending with unwanted thoughts, feelings, or behaviours, frequently referred to as 'symptoms'. These symptoms often surface as adaptive responses to earlier challenges, particularly when other options may have been scarce. One of the remarkable faculties of our minds is the ability to encode these solutions into our implicit memory, automating them into what we might call our 'autopilot'. While this can be advantageous, facilitating numerous tasks without requiring much conscious effort, these once adaptive patterns may feel more like obstacles than solutions over time, or as our circumstances evolve.
                <br><br>
                Rather than categorising these patterns as 'bad' and striving to suppress them, my therapeutic approach focuses on uncovering their origins and recognising the value they either once had or may still have in your life. This exploration happens not only at an intellectual level but also on a more profound, emotional, or felt sense level. Take the example of a relentless inner critic. While it may be presently overwhelming, it could have originally served as a protective mechanism to anticipate and manage others' reactions.
                <br><br>
                Every decision we make carries advantages and drawbacks, which may not be entirely visible when initially taken, given our varying emotional states and changing life circumstances. For example, at some point, you may have chosen to dodge discomfort, only to find that this choice eventually led to feelings of loneliness or emptiness.
                <br><br>
                Such choices might have been made by a part of your mind in the past, preserved in implicit memory, and subsequently forgotten, resulting in the conscious mind feeling at odds with the unconscious/implicit mind. This dynamic might resemble two teams within a company working against each other.
                <br><br>
                While we can attempt to understand these components of our mind intellectually, genuine resolution of internal conflict often arises when we engage with these parts on an emotional level. This involves progressing beyond a purely logical grasp of a perspective and cultivating a deep, embodied understanding. This depth of comprehension can nurture a more compassionate and nuanced relationship with these aspects of ourselves, fostering more fruitful internal collaboration. The end product of this process often entails either developing a greater tolerance for the inner mechanics of the mind, or a re-assessment and adjustment of past decisions on an emotional level.
                <br><br>
                Through therapy, the goal is to surface these unconscious decisions into conscious awareness, shedding light on the choices various aspects of yourself made in the past. Recognising these choices does not mean rejecting these parts, but instead acknowledging them, appreciating their significance, and reconsidering their ongoing role in your life. This fosters an environment of openness, understanding, and harmony between the conscious and unconscious mind.
                <br><br>
                Enhanced self-awareness opens the door for exploring alternative choices that harmonise better with your current needs and circumstances, or for fostering a deeper acceptance of a choice that continues to be beneficial. As your therapist, my role is to guide you on this journey towards acknowledging and integrating all aspects of your mind, with the ultimate aim of improving your mental health and overall well-being.
              </p>
                <!-- 
                I think that a helpful way to think about mental health is in terms of internal conflict. People seeking psychological support are often in the position of experiencing unwanted thoughts, feelings, or compulsions/behaviors. We can refer to these as "symptoms." These symptoms typically develop as a solution to an early problem, when better alternatives are unavailable or inaccessible. Over time, these thought patterns become automatic, and when our circumstances change, we may start to view them as detrimental.
<br><br>
In response, we might attempt to repress these patterns and label the entire thought pattern as "bad." For example, someone with a harsh inner critic might decide that all self-criticism is harmful and try to suppress it. However, this repression has two significant consequences.
<br><br>
Firstly, it appears that subconscious thought patterns are challenging to change if they remain hidden. To alter them, we need to get in touch with the version of ourselves which created the solution in the first place. Secondly, (if we assume that evolution has shaped all mental activities to be useful in some context) repressing a thought pattern may deprive us of its benefits. As a result, an unmet need for this pattern may build up, leading to a swing back towards it, often manifesting in an unwanted form.
<br><br>
My approach to therapy revolves around understanding these symptoms, their origins, and the value of the underlying thought pattern. By exploring the functions they serve and finding ways to balance these needs with other ways of being, clients can achieve a more harmonious state, either a middle ground which incorporates two different ways of being, or an acceptance of the different ways of being.
<br><br>
In essence, my approach to therapy is about guiding clients towards greater self-awareness and an understanding of their symptoms, helping them appreciate the value of their thought patterns, and discovering how to find balance in their lives. By doing so, clients can learn to embrace and integrate all aspects of their minds, ultimately leading to improved mental health and well-being.</p> -->
