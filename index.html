                Hello! My name is David O'Donohue, and I am a registered psychologist and clinical psychology registrar.
                I am currently accepting new clients (note that I do not provide assessment services, and am not accepting
                new clients under the age of 18). New and existing clients can make appointments either online
                through <a href="https://pendulumpsychology.com.au/booking.html">the booking page</a>, or through the
                <a href="https://www.halaxy.com/profile/virtus-psychology/location/626281" target="_blank">Halaxy online portal</a>.
                To make an inquiry, or for assistance in booking an appointment, please contact me via email at
                <a href="mailto:pendulumpsychology@gmail.com">pendulumpsychology@gmail.com</a>. 
                <br><br>
                Many people seeking psychological support find themselves grappling with unwanted thoughts, feelings, or compulsions/behaviors, what we often call 'symptoms.' These symptoms typically emerge as solutions to early challenges, especially when better options are unavailable. Over time, these thought patterns can become automatic, and when our circumstances change, they can start to feel more like obstacles than solutions.
<br><br>
                Rather than labeling these patterns as 'bad' and trying to suppress them, my approach to therapy aims to uncover their origins and understand the value they once had in your life. Think of a harsh inner critic, for example. While its constant criticism may feel overwhelming, it might have started as a way to predict and prepare for how others may react to you.
        <br><br>        
                By understanding these symptoms and the role they've played, we can then explore new ways to meet the same needs. Maybe you have tried to silence your inner critic completely, but are finding this inner conflict exhausting. Sometimes, understanding your inner critic can open the door to collaborating with it more harmoniously.
                <br><br>
                My aim is to guide you towards greater self-awareness and an understanding of your symptoms, helping you appreciate the value of your thought patterns, and supporting you in finding balance in your life. This journey allows you to embrace and integrate all aspects of your mind, leading to improved mental health and well-being.
</p>
<!-- 
                I think that a helpful way to think about mental health is in terms of internal conflict. People seeking psychological support are often in the position of experiencing unwanted thoughts, feelings, or compulsions/behaviors. We can refer to these as "symptoms." These symptoms typically develop as a solution to an early problem, when better alternatives are unavailable or inaccessible. Over time, these thought patterns become automatic, and when our circumstances change, we may start to view them as detrimental.
<br><br>
In response, we might attempt to repress these patterns and label the entire thought pattern as "bad." For example, someone with a harsh inner critic might decide that all self-criticism is harmful and try to suppress it. However, this repression has two significant consequences.
<br><br>
Firstly, it appears that subconscious thought patterns are challenging to change if they remain hidden. To alter them, we need to get in touch with the version of ourselves which created the solution in the first place. Secondly, (if we assume that evolution has shaped all mental activities to be useful in some context) repressing a thought pattern may deprive us of its benefits. As a result, an unmet need for this pattern may build up, leading to a swing back towards it, often manifesting in an unwanted form.
<br><br>
My approach to therapy revolves around understanding these symptoms, their origins, and the value of the underlying thought pattern. By exploring the functions they serve and finding ways to balance these needs with other ways of being, clients can achieve a more harmonious state, either a middle ground which incorporates two different ways of being, or an acceptance of the different ways of being.
<br><br>
In essence, my approach to therapy is about guiding clients towards greater self-awareness and an understanding of their symptoms, helping them appreciate the value of their thought patterns, and discovering how to find balance in their lives. By doing so, clients can learn to embrace and integrate all aspects of their minds, ultimately leading to improved mental health and well-being.</p> -->
